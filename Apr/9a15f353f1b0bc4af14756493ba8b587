My kinda craft is legit and clean. I am not bribing my way up. Avoid what is not necessary. Inspiration Knowing where you want to go is the first thing; then you plan means and ways to achieve that goal, in this instance, making music for the world, not your locals alone. I stay true to myself and I don’t follow the crowd. I always try to make quality music and worry less about quantity. COVID-19 The COVID-19 (pandemic) has affected the business side of things mainly, but not the creative side. We are still working and getting sharper. Away from music I am a director at a company called Tizzletech (Private) Limited, but everything has been affected business-wise (in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak). We offer accounting, taxation and entertainment services, just to mention a few. Future Prospects I have been working on a lot of projects. There are many collaborations to come, engaging more with the outside world — collaborations and partnerships and basically just making the product fit for the outside market.
