ZIMBABWE-FOCUSED lithium miner Prospect Resources Limited has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sibelco N V aimed at promoting the start of Arcadia’s ultra-low iron petalite production. BY TAFADZWA MHLANGA In a statement, the company said the MoU will give the two parties a chance to negotiate and implement a binding offtake agreement for Arcadia’s ultra-low iron petalite product set to be signed on June 1 this year. Prospect executive chairman Hugh Warner said: “I am pleased to announce that we have signed an Mou with Sibelco for Arcadia’s premium ultra-low iron petalite. Sibelco is the largest distributor of ultra-low iron petalite in Europe and possibly the world. It is a significant ‘blue chip’ European customer, with annual turnover of some €3,5 billion. Once in production, Prospect will be the largest ultra-low iron petalite producer in the world.” While Prospect and Sibelco have agreed not to deal with any other party in relation to the supply of ultra-low iron petalite, nothing in the MoU prohibits Prospect from continuing discussions with the Uranium One Group.
