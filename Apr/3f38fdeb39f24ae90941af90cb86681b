BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE The matter came to light at the Guruve Magistrates Courts yesterday when Anymore Zitsva (27) and Simbarashe Nyambare (22) appeared before resident magistrate Shingirai Mutiro. Mutiro sentenced them to 36 months and conditionally suspended six months.

After noticing that officers were playing checkers, the inmates cut a hole through the security fence and tried to escape.
