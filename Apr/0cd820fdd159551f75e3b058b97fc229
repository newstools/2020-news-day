Coventry, who chairs the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission, said the platform was aimed at providing support for both athletes and artists during the pandemic. “We have started an initiative called UPAZIM,” Coventry said. “We want to achieve three things. “Firstly we want to create unity with all of us and secondly, we want to create awareness of all of our athletes and artists. “Thirdly, we want to create a relief fund for these athletes and artists. “I would like to thank the artists and athletes who are becoming part of my team to help set this up.” The coronavirus pandemic has heavily impacted sport, with numerous competitions having been postponed or cancelled due the crisis. This has had a knock-on impact on athletes, who have seen their opportunities to secure income be affected by the loss of events. In excess of 1,8 million coronavirus cases have been reported worldwide, which has led to the deaths of more than 117 000 people. Zimbabwe has so far announced 14 coronavirus cases to date, with three deaths recorded.
