UPCOMING Afro-jazz artiste Thabani “Jah Tee” Ndlovu has released a single track on the deadly COVID-19 which has brought untold suffering globally. BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE In the track titled Zvirwere Zvinongonyukanyuka, Jah Tee implores God to protect Zimbabwe and Africa from the pandemic. Having recorded one album, Musha Mukadzi, in 2017, the Kwekwe-based musician was pushed back into the studio this year by the deadly pandemic, but the latest offering was recorded last week at Classic Records in Mbare, Harare. “As an artiste, I have seen the dangers of the deadly coronavirus and how it has shattered the whole world. Hence, I thought of going back in the studio and beg God to protect us from the disease,” Jah Tee said. “I am still trying to get airplay as you know we are up and coming to get recognised is difficult, but the song is making rounds in clubs, homes and social media.” The artiste said people should follow the government’s mitigatory measures to help curb the spread of the pandemic. “This disease is real and people should take heed from what the government is telling them to do and we, as musicians, should keep educating people about the disease through music,” he said. Jah Tee was formerly employed by Andy Muridzo as a driver, then moved to join raunchy dancer Beverly Sibanda doing the same work before dumping all that for the mic.
