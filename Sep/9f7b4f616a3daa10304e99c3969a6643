“I had great interest in music from a tender age as I used to listen to so many songs and sing along, but was never in a school or church choir, hence it became a bit easier to express my views about life through observing,” he said. The Ndimi Moga hitmaker said his music was influenced by his Christian faith. He revealed that the band was born in 2017 after he created a club which was mostly centred on discussing life in general and see how best they could tackle challenges in life.
“It all started with This is life (TiL) club in January 2017 at Regina Mundi Girls High School where we would discuss life in general. When we launched the club I Wang “Iwe Daira Akuitire”, colleagues and learners encouraged me to record, I took the challenge and I recorded,” he said. This is Life is composed of Regina Mundi Girls High School pupils and Chinaka, the band leader and composer.The pupils are not permanent members, as they leave the band after completion of their studies.
