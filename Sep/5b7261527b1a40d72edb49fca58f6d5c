BY FREEMAN MAKOPA AFRO-POP songbird Thamsanqa “Tamy” Moyo has revealed that her latest collaboration with Jah Prayzah on the song Kuteera, which she described as an incredible experience, has attracted positive responses from fans. “It was their wish beginning of the year to see this happen. I did my best to grant their wish. I am happy with their support for the project and so grateful for it too,” she said. “It was an incredible experience. We took this as an exchange of experiences and sound as well. He is a warm, welcoming character. I learnt how to work with precision and focus and how to create good energy in my work environment. He taught me that no matter how big you are, you are never too big to be advised and corrected. He is also taught me to work to perfection in everything I do.” Tamy told NewsDay Life & Style that her vision was to do projects from outside Zimbabwe and expressed satisfaction over the steps she was taking to ensure she achieves her goals.
“My vision is only bigger from here. My eye is set on a few projects outside of Zimbabwe. I hope and pray that an album will be the result of all this work I have been putting in lately. I’m really excited by every little step I take towards achieving my dreams and goals on a daily basis. I’m happy about all the things I have discovered I can do and overcoming some of my fears day-by-day,” she said. Tamy said she had no regrets because everything that happened in her music career “has been either a win or a learning curve”. The talented songstress, who defied the odds when she exposed her other talent as she featured in a movie titled Gonarezhou, which premiered in Turkey, continues to shine on the local music scene. Tamy has a rich history in music, having shared the stage with international artistes including Joe Thomas and top local artistes like the late music superstar Oliver Mtukudzi, Stunner, Ba Shupi and Alexio Kawara.
