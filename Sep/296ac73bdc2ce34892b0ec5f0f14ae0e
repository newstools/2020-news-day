BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA Opposition MDC Alliance candidate for Marondera mayoral elections, Bornface Tagwireyi, was yesterday defeated by MDC-T candidate Simbarashe Nyahuye in a tight contest held at council chambers. Nyahuye polled four votes, while Tagwireyi got three votes, as the Thokozani Khupe-led party continued decimating Chamisa’s camp. Seven councillors cast their votes, including a Zanu PF councillor, resulting in Nyahuye landing the mayoral post. Speaking after the elections, MDC-T interim secretary-general Douglas Mwonzora said: “We are elated at the election of councillor Nyahuye. We recalled those councillors after realising that they had ceased to be members of the MDC-T as well as being involved in corruption.” Mwonzora added that his next target was Harare City Council. “We are going back to Harare to deal with the mess there. Now that PDP [People’s Democratic Party] has recalled (newly-elected mayor Jacob) Mafume, we are now set for another election to replace him,” he said. Five MDC Alliance councillors, including mayor Chengetai Murowa, were recently recalled by Khupe after they refused to declare their allegiance to MDC-T.
