PEOPLE in detention centres, as well as those who look after them, should not be left out in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, as they also need to be equipped. By Garikai Tunhira Speaking at a handover of medical sundries and personal protective equipment at Greys Prison in Bulawayo last Friday, American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) country representative Nthabiseng Nkomo said: “As people come together across the globe to keep each other healthy and safe, it is critical that we extend the same level of care to members of our community who are in prisons, jails and detention centres, together with their families and communities.” She added: “We should all actively guard against the bait of self-preservation and neglect marginalised and vulnerable members of our society who need us the most during these critical times. As AFSC, we desire to see a healthier and safer community for all.” The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR), in partnership with AFSC, donated hand sanitisers, 20-litre water containers with taps, liquid soap, disinfectants, thermometers, washable masks and gloves to the detention centre. ZADHR executive director Calvin Fambirai said the donation was “part of a broader campaign to enhance health systems resilience in the face of COVID-19.” “In the past few weeks, we have made similar gestures at Mutare City Council, Masvingo City Council, Gweru City Council and even here at United Bulawayo Hospitals. We all have a right to a safe working environment or habitat.” The human rights doctors are on a drive to help equip local authorities and municipalities in the fight against COVID-19.
