By SIMBARASHE SITHOLE THREE Bindura men were yesterday sentenced to a combined 27 years by local magistrate Ethel Chichera after they stole an ox valued at US$400. Osward Hoya (32), Nigel Chitedza (25) and David Makava (29) were sentenced to a mandatory nine-year-jail each. Prosecutor Sheilla Kudzai Maribha told the court that on July 9, the trio broke into Peter Dyare’s pen in Murugweni village and stole an ox which they drove to Chirikadzi village.
The trio secured the stolen ox, which they intended to sell, in Makava’s pen. The complainant teamed up with other villagers soon after discovering that his ox was missing and recovered the beast from Makava’s pen.
Makava implicated his accomplices.
