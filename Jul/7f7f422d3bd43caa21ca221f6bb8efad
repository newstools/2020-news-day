The pictures alone tell the whole story. I am heading in the right direction. This is a clear example of working hard to stay fit and there is no excuse for women out there to neglect their bodies. Projects
I am working on my ninth album called Up the Ladder and you must expect it. Definitely 2020, you will get an album. On collaborations, Yes, there are collaborations but local ones. I assembled an all-female ensemble Intombi Zom’qangala and I managed to tour other countries such as England, Canada and Russia. Entrepreneurship
I am a versatile entrepreneur. I do everything that brings money to the table. I sell vegetables, I breed chickens, I sing and do buying and selling and I am also into mining. In short, I do all sorts of things. Marriage
My marriage is my pillar of strength. For me to be where I am today it’s because of this marriage, so I will say to all the ladies out there: it’s an interesting journey. Dance
As of dancing, yes I have mentored and groomed a lot of dancers, but I am still dancing. Best-kept secret
I am a good cook
