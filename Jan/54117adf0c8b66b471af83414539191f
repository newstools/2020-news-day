Jaure played a key role at the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company-owned side which managed its season target of avoiding relegation, finishing on fifth position in its debut season in the top-flight league. The departure of Jaure jolted the Mutare-based side into action on the transfer market and they have engaged Ndlovu.

Ndlovu (35) has seen it all in the local top-flight league, having played for several teams including the Harare giants Dynamos. Having missed out on Premier Soccer League promotion with Buffaloes who were pipped by Tenax, the defender has seen another avenue into the big time fling open. NewsDay Sport has also been told that Black Rhinos goalkeeper Ashley Reyners could be on his way to Manica Diamonds so is striker Tawanda Nyamandwe, who was offloaded by ZPC Kariba. Manica Diamonds chairman Masimba Chihowa yesterday chose to keep his cards close to the chest, saying they would announce new acquisitions when they have concluded the transfer business. “We are still in negotiations with some players. We will announce our final squad very soon, we don’t want to jeopardise negotiations that we are having,” he said.
