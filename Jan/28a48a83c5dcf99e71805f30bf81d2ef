BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER AFRO-FUSION artiste Ashton “Mbeu” Nyahora will this Friday treat his fans and music lovers to a free show as a way of helping ease the financial burden normally associated with the first month of the year at Maestro Restaurant and Bar in Harare. The show, which will also be an occasion to celebrate media practitioner, Nigel “Kabila” Nyamutumbu’s birthday, will be hosted by popular chanter Stanford “MC Stansplash” Chibanda. Mbeu’s manager, Eugene Museredza, said music was therapy and by allowing people to celebrate life without parting with money was a way of giving back to the community. “Most musicians take a break in January, not only due to fatigue emanating from the hectic festive season, but also due to the fact that it’s not profitable to host a show at a time people have squeezed pockets,” he said. “For us at the Mhodzi Tribe, we view music as both business and a calling such that we empathise with our fans and when possible we give back to them as we will do on Friday.” He also indicated that the band would be releasing an album and a singles collection later in the year. “We have done many collaborations that we are yet to release, including one with our mentor and father the late national hero Oliver Mtukudzi,” he said. MC Stansplash, the event host, said he was relishing an opportunity to interact with music lovers. “Maestro is establishing itself as a house of top drawer shows, where some of the top brands in the music industry among them Gaffa and JP have performed. We are as such not taking this event lightly and we have a strong appetite to deliver and demonstrate our readiness for the big league,” he said. He said those who are willing to join the VIP were welcome to make bookings on either his or the Mhodzi Tribe social media sites.
