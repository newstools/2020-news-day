BY CHELSEA MUSAFARE PROLIFIC saxophonist Joseph “Jose Sax” Chinouriri will early next month stage a tribute show in honour of music superstar Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi who died on January 22 last year. The show will be in commemoration of the first anniversary of the legend and national hero’s death. Chinouriri, who also played at the late Sam Mtukudzi’s memorial gig, told NewsDay Life & Style that the show will be a collaboration with top music producer and instrumentalist Clive “Mono” Mukundu. The saxophonist said he roped in Mukundu because he was a renowned jazz artiste and instrumentalist who worked with Tuku for many years as part of the Black Spirits band. Although Chinouriri said he regretted missing opportunities to record with the late music icon, he found it prudent to honour Tuku for the inspiration he gave him through songs. “There are songs I featured on his music, like on his last album titled Haasati Aziva. I also worked on another album with Tuku and Hugh Masekela, which was a great honour. It was a dream come true. I was close to him and I really learnt a lot playing my instrument, how to work with others, professionalism, how to live life and how to be you,” he said. He recalled that Tuku also attended his debut Exclusive Brass section event in 2018. “I thank God that I am one of the few young men in my generation who worked close to him, travelled with him and was mentored by him,” he said. Chinouriri’s Exclusive Brass Section, mentored and inspired by Tuku, has developed one trombonist who plays for Jah Prayzah and a saxophonist playing for Andy Muridzo.
