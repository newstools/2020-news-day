BY TERRY MADYAUTA HARARE giants Caps United and Chicken Inn have joined the race to sign TelOne forward King Nadolo, as the two sides seek to reinforce their squads ahead of the 2020 league season. Nadolo flourished at the relegated TelOne last season to earn a place on the 2019 Soccer Star of the Year calendar, after netting eleven goals. He only joined the team midway through the season. Caps United have been on a shopping spree of late, having already snatched Leeroy Mavunga from Yadah and Tatenda Tumba from Harare City. They are desperate to replace some of their stars who have left the club. These include 2019 Soccer Star of the Year Joel Ngodzo who moved to Zambian side, Buildcon. Chicken Inn have also been very busy on the transfer market and have confirmed the arrival of midfielder Clive Dzingai from relegated Mushowani Stars. They were, however, gazumped to the signature of Nomore Chinyerere by FC Platinum. Nadolo’s manager, Basil Tangamani revealed that Caps United and Chicken Inn were angling for the exciting midfielder, who is also on FC Platinum and Ngezi Platinum’s radar. He said Nadolo’s move away from the Gweru-based side was inevitable even if TelOne manage to buy a franchise to return into the premier league. “We are still working on it. I have sent him away on holiday in the meantime. January deals are always difficult to conclude, but we are still hopeful that he will be moving on regardless of TelOne buying a franchise,” Tangamani said. “At the moment, I have been contacted by Chicken Inn and Caps United, while FC Platinum and Ngezi have also expressed interest,” he said.
