BY NIZBERT MOYO Hwange Local Board and the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) are at loggerheads, with the former accusing the water management body of using its infrastructure to supply water to residents without paying to the local authority. Hwange Local Board deputy chairperson Admire Munhenga told Southern Eye last Friday that since Zinwa took over the supply of water, it has not met its end of the bargain. “We are supposed to get 35% from revenue collection coming from water supplies after residents have paid, but Zinwa has not been paying this to us since they took over the water supply from us,’’ he said. “We used to buy water from them, but they took over. The piping is ours and they took over the sewer system (which is now) in a dilapidated state. We engaged Parliament, after teaming up with the residents, but to no avail.” Munhenga said they wanted to be accorded town status, but that would not be possible as long as they are facing such challenges. He revealed that the town hoped to use Zinwa remittances to improve health facilities. Zinwa spokesperson Marjorie Munyonga said the water management body had a right to use  the infrastructure for free since it was a government arm responsible for all water and related infrastructure. “Government has put up that infrastructure and we are the government arm tasked to use, manage, maintain and develop the infrastructure,’’ she said.
