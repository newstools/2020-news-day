BY CHELSEA MUSAFARE RISING male model Mr Zimbabwe finalist and telecommunications engineering student Calvin Nare Jnr is set to launch a charity group designed to support the less-privileged and offer mentorship as a way of reducing child marriages. The 21-year-old model told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that the idea to start the Models Against Poverty (MAP) project was inspired by successful models such as Tapiwa Mutsimba who was awarded the Best Charity Model at Zimbabwe Models Awards last year. “Back to school campaign set for Saturday is our first campaign since we recently started the group. We have up-and-coming models who are also giving a helping hand like Tapiwa Mutsimba, Chacha Sevy, Author (Rango), Musa, Pride and Clint,” he said. “My dream and wish is to see a smile on every child’s face. I believe this will reduce cases of early child marriages and drug abuse because children will spend most of their time at school.” Nare, who is also the president of TelOne Centre for Learning Modelling Club (TCFL) said he was inspired to make a difference in children’s lives. “Schools have opened, who will buy uniforms, shoes, satchels, books, pens, pencils, rulers, covers, lunch boxes for them (children)? It is the rainy season now and our brothers and sisters need raincoats and umbrellas. Let us give a helping hand as models today,” he said. “We are asking everyone who wishes to assist — think of that old school uniform, jersey that you no longer need, someone is in need of it.” Nare, who is also a poet, designer, artiste and dancer, believes that children are the future, hence the nation should take some responsibility to care for them. As part of his modelling career, Nare contested at the Mr Zimbabwe 2019-2020 pageant and made it to the finals. He also won the first prince crown of Mr Zim Hip Hop Street Lights and he is an information technology student at Pace College.
