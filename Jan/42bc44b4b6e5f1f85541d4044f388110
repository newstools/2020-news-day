BY FREEMAN MAKOPA GOSPEL musician Mambo Dhuterere — who has divided opinion among gospel music lovers following his meteoric rise to fame with his new album Dare Guru — yesterday said he will soon launch a charity initiative to assist the less privileged. Dhuterere told NewsDay Life & Style he believed that helping the needy was part of his calling as a gospel musician. “The main thing for me is I was doing charity back in Botswana and it was not easy to do that in a foreign land. So, if God permits me, I will be more into charity, going around looking for those in need and finding ways to help them,” he said. “That’s what I believe God raised me to do. I don’t believe he raised me for people to point at me and say, that’s Dhuterere. Then what? I should use this fame to look after people who are in need.” Dhuterere said someone approached him seeking assistance to open a home for the needy and he was delighted to partner them because the initiative tallied with his vision. “But as for my charity work, I will start and fund it from my pocket although there will be room for those who would like to join in,” he said. Meanwhile, the musician hinted that he would be releasing his next album in August this year.
