IP-and-coming gospel musician Kundai “Kundy” Mandizvidza has urged fellow musicians not to rely on music alone
for survival. By Simbarashe Sithole The Mvurwi-based artiste, who is also
a merchandiser at Seed Co in the farming
town, recorded four singles last year.
His music enjoys significant airplay on
radio. Before the COVID-19-induced lock-
down, Kundy staged two shows in Glen-
dale and Mvurwi. “A lot of artistes rely on music alone
for survival and that is very dangerous as proven by this COVID-19 era. Those who rely on music alone are suffering since they have not been generating any income for close to two months now,” Kundy said. “So, I urge musicians to be versatile and do other income-generating projects for them to survive.” A lot of musicians, who depend on public
performances, have been severely affected by the lockdown. Just recently, South Africa-based artiste King 98 donated cash and food items to Utakataka Express stage manager, chanter and choreographer Gift “Shiga Shiga” Katulika. South Africa-based rhumba kwasa artiste Dino Mudondo recently sent an SOS
through his Facebook page begging for assistance saying he was on the verge of starvation as he has not been able to stage any shows due to the lockdown implemented in that country.
