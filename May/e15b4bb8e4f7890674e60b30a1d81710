FORGOTTEN former Dynamos forward Farai Mupasiri  says he is ready to revive his career following a long injury lay-off that kept him out of the game for the better part of last season. BY TERRY MADYAUTA The forward was in the books of Gweru-based side Chapungu, where he only played four matches for the Airforce of Zimbabwe side before he was injured. He is currently unattached, but is confident of a return soon. “I am now well and recovering to the fullest. I will be back before you know it. These injuries are part of the risks of the game, but that cannot stop me from coming back because I have been working hard for a return,” the former Shabanie Mine captain told NewsDay Sport. “It is difficult to spend so much time inactive, but it is all behind me now and I am hopeful for better luck this time. “The injury was a major setback, but I am confident that I will be able to play this season.” Prior to joining Chapungu, Mupasiri played for the Zvishavane arch-rivals Shabanie Mine and FC Platinum in 2017 and 2018 respectively. At FC Platinum, he was reduced to a bench-warmer and the experience was a forgetable one.
At Shabanie Mine, he established himself as the club’s mainstay. Despite their financial woes, Mupasiri made the Takesure Chiragwi-coached team worthy underdogs. Of interest was his lethal combination with former Black Rhinos midfielder Trevor Ajana and Bruno Mtigo that terrorised opponents in the league.
