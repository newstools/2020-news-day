WEDZA South MP and Youth, Sports, Arts and Recreation deputy minister Tinoda Machakaire has donated personal protective equipment and food to eight clinics in his constituency to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. By Staff Reporter The donation included hand sanitisers, face masks, latex gloves and rice. Wedza is in Mashonaland East province, one of the COVID-19 hotspots in the country with five  cases. Speaking at the handover ceremony at Mt St Mary’s Dendenyore Clinic, Machakaire said the fight against COVID-19 was a collective one and should not be left to the government alone. “This is not a political thing, but a disease that can leave all of us dead. We have seen it claiming lives here in Zimbabwe and across the globe. Therefore, everyone has a duty to take part in this fight,” he said. Machakaire said it was important for health workers and other frontline workers to get the equipment first. “Of the things we have brought here, we have considered our health workers who are at risk. They are doing a great job in this fight against COVID-19,” he said. Mashonaland East Provincial Affairs minister Aplonia Munzverengwi expressed gratitude over Machakaire’s donation. “We want to thank Honourable Machakaire for giving us the equipment that will help us fight against the disease. Complementing government efforts to save lives is one thing we should praise him for. This will go a long
way to assist in the fight against the disease,” she said. Chief Svosve urged his subjects to abide by the set lockdown measures to contain the disease.
