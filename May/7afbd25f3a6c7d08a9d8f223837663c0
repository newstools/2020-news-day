THE African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved a $13,7 million grant towards Zimbabwe’s COVID-19 response. The funds will provide a lifeline for targeted frontline responders and health personnel and boost the country’s
global health security index in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The grant was approved on May 13, after a request from the Zimbabwe government, AfDB said in a statement released on Thursday. The funds will go to Zimbabwe’s COVID-19 response project (CRP) to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. The CRP will focus on 15 high-density suburbs in Harare as well as satellite townships and targeted health facilities in other areas of the country. Activities under the project include boosting capacity in COVID-19 prevention and management protocols for
healthcare personnel and populations. The activities will also include increasing access to COVID-19 hand washing facilities in Harare, satellite
townships and other affected regions, supply of COVID-19 medical equipment and laboratory test kits and
