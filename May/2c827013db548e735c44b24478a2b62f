LISTED cable manufacturer Cafca says it believes it will remain in business in the foreseeable future mainly due to no foreign debts and consistent supply of raw materials, despite the effects of COVID-19 threatening the survival of businesses globally. By Fidelity Mhlanga “Management has assessed that the company will continue operating as a going concern on the basis that the company has no exposure to foreign liabilities, stock of six months deliveries in finished goods. Raw materials suppliers are still shipping,” the company said in its half year results for the period ended March 31, 2020. The company’s optimism also derived from the fact that it has secured loans and overdraft facilities to the tune of $31 million and its operations have been classified as an essential service. Cafca said despite the impact of coronavirus on the market, it was still pursuing a monthly sales model of
140 tonnes to the export market. “Assisting Cafca to mitigate these threats are our finished goods stock of 746 tonnes and our export consignment stock arrangements. We have commitments from our raw material suppliers that our immediate needs will be met with only our imported spare parts requirement being a minor challenge. Despite the expected local market liquidity constraints, indications from our local customers are that local sales expectations will be met,” the company said.
