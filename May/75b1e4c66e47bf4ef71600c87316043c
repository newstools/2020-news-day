By Miriam Mangwaya The girl’s grandfather (60), who cannot be named to protect the identity of the minor, yesterday appeared before Chivhu regional magistrate Fadzai Mtombeni facing rape charges.

Prosecutor Audrey Mpini told the court that on May 5, 2020, at around 8pm, the complainant was sleeping in her bedroom with her three-year-old sister. Her grandfather entered the bedroom and asked whether she was asleep and the complainant told him she was awake. He then went to where she was sleeping and raped her once. The complainant did not scream for help. The following day, she told her brother how she was sexually abused, but her brother did not disclose it to anyone. On May 7, 2020, the complainant wrote to her parents, telling them what her grandfather had done to her. Her mother reported the matter to the police, leading to the accused’s arrest.
