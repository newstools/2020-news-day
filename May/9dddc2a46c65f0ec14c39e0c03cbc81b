THE Econet group has imported 100 000 COVID-19 test kits for use in testing critical target groups such as essential services staff, the elderly and vulnerable, as the country enters its seventh week under lockdown.
The group’s Cassava Smartech Zimbabwe chief executive officer Eddie Chibi,  whose health business includes Maisha Health Fund and Maisha Medik and has been investing in testing solutions, said the group’s commercial entities had partnered with Higherlife Foundation to bring in the much-needed test kits.
“We are pleased to announce that we have imported 100 000 COVID-19 test kits to be used for testing our own staff, individuals and corporates across Zimbabwe,” Chibi said. “The corporates will pay a fee for the testing of their staff, which can be done on-site or off-site.” To accelerate the testing process, Chibi said Maisha had developed a franchise model, through which service providers approved by the  Health ministry would be issued with test kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) for free, for them to conduct tests. Higherlife Foundation chief exeucitve officer Kennedy Mubaiwa said the foundation would be rolling out free testing to vulnerable citizens. Cassava Healthtech chief operating officer, Denver Phiri said investing in testing solutions in order to be able to test, isolate, treat and trace contacts to curb the spread of COVID-19 was a key recommendation of the World Health Organisation.
