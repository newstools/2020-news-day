GOSPEL musician Loice Namatai Chinyerere says she has embraced the use of different social media platforms to reach a wider audience as she launched the video of her song, Neni Handikurase, live on YouTube on Friday.  BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Chinyerere opted for an online launch following the national lockdown necessitated by the need to check the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Chinyerere told NewsDay Life & Style, yesterday that technology has enabled her to connect with fans across the continent and she will be using different social media platforms to share her music. “We are now living in a digital era, so as an artiste I have embraced technology to reach a wider audience not only local, but beyond the borders,” she said. She said the video, produced by Andy Cutta, was centred on an underprivileged young girl who finds God’s favour and gets engaged to her beloved with the theme that God would never forsake believers. The 25-year-old singer said the desire to touch many lives pushed her into music, adding that she was happy getting many testimonies from her compositions. “I believe my purpose in life is to convey God’s message through singing. I am delighted to carry the title minister as God has chosen me to serve in his Kingdom making sure souls are being brought to the kingdom where people are uplifted, being healed and delivered,” she said. Chinyerere signalled her arrival on the showbiz scene in 2014 and released her debut album Jehovah in 2019 that was to be followed by Munoera in the same year on which she featured music producer Taziwa Mbwizhu. The songstress has also released 10 singles with the help of producers Blessing Masanga and Lyton Ngolomi.
