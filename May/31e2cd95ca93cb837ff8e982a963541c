THE Midlands State University (MSU) has printed 678 000 information booklets on COVID-19 to be distributed nationwide as part of efforts to fight the spread of the virus. By Stephen Chadenga MSU spokespoerson Alex Mukwembi said the booklets were available in the 16 local languages, among them braille and sign language. “We have begun dispatching the booklets to provincial information officers in all the country’s 10 provinces,” Mukwembi said recently. “The quantities are in line with the language demographics in the country. Each province will also receive 30 000 booklets in English and the rest will be distributed on a pro-rata basis according to the popular language in the region.” He said the move was necessitated by the need to give information on the pandemic in languages easily understood by the people.
