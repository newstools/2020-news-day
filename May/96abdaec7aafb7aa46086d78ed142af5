BULAWAYO musician and cleric Tapiwanashe Jefta Marambi, who recently released the single, Munesu, has urged the nation to keep praying for God’s intervention in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and appealed for support towards the less privileged affected by the outbreak. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Munesu is a song in English, Shona and Ndebele which expresses faith that even though nations are in difficult moments due to coronavirus, God had not forsaken them. Marambi told NewsDay Life & Style that nations needed to pray knowing that everything was under God’s control. “We need to keep on praying for God’s intervention whom I have the faith that he is with us, hence the song Munesu. We have to pray for those diagnosed with COVID-19 to recover quickly, protection of healthcare givers and for the virus to stop spreading. There is need to pray for a vaccine to be discovered. Many people lose hope in a crisis, but surely this shall be a thing of the past. We need to pray and have faith that the situation is under God’s control,” he said. The Methodist Church in Zimbabwe pastor based in Mzilikazi,  said there was also need to support the less privileged people who were struggling to bring food on the table. “In addition to praying, we also need to extend a helping hand to the less privileged who include many people who live with disability. The pandemic robbed them of their source of income as many relied on vending in towns, something which is not yet safe to do. We need to be our brother’s keeper as some are sleeping on empty stomachs. Your effort also sends a message that there is God,” he said. Marambi released his debut album KunaMwari Zvitaure last year via Radio Zimbabwe.
