EIGHTY-NINE Zimbabwean returnees quarantined in Beitbridge were on Tuesday released without their final COVID-19 test results. BY REX MPHISA They included eight recently contracted government environmental health technicians, a similar number of truckers, a prison warden who had gone on a shopping trip and a policeman who also had travelled to South Africa. No official comment was obtained from government yesterday, but the quarantined inmates, who kept close contact with the NewsDay, said they had arrived at their different provincial destinations and kept overnight at government institutions. They were kept at Bulawayo, Masvingo, Mutare and Harare Polytechnic Colleges from where they were released yesterday after being profiled. “They said our results will be brought home and we are expected to be isolated at home until results come,” one of the returned said. One of those who went to Masvingo said they had been received well, but the same could not be said for the ones who went to Harare, who claimed they slept on the bus. “We found everything ready and we were given fresh bedding at Masvingo Polytechnic. We had good meals and it was well arranged,” a contact dropped in Masvingo said. Meanwhile, the Beitbridge quarantine centre has introduced meal tickets to guard against some hungry residents who were now coming to the well-catered for centre for meals.
