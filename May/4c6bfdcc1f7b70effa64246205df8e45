SOUTH AFRICA-BASED Zimbabwean hip-hop artiste Ngonidzashe “King 98” Dondo yesterday brought smiles to fellow musicians Progress Chipfumo, Congolese rhumba singer Gift Katulika aka Shiga Shiga and drummer Sam Mataure after donating to them an assortment of food hampers worth $10 000 in Harare in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The global pandemic COVID-19-induced national lockdown has disrupted most livelihoods including artistes’ capacity to generate income through live shows. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, King 98 said giving was a gesture of sharing with fellow artistes whose work has been affected by the lockdown. “I know this is not enough for them, but I just decided to share the little that I had spared for the shooting of my video which I have however, put on hold due to the COVID-19 outbreak,” he said.
“I was so touched when I learnt through the media that my fellow artiste Shiga Shiga was appealing for assistance… I, therefore, decided to assist with the little that I could and also extend a hand to my brothers Sam and Proggie.” King 98 said he appreciated the effects of the lockdown on artistes in Zimbabwe unlike in South Africa where they could get revenue from different platforms such as iTunes and Spotify. The trio thanked the youthful crooner for the gesture. “I thank God for opening King 98 and Mudhara Dondo’s for answering my call for help. As artirtes we must live the real life, not the exaggerated one. That is why I decided to open up on my situation as I had nothing to eat and feed the family,” he said. Chipfumo also expressed gratitude to King 98, Impala Car Rentals and Josh Hozheri for their support. Mataure suffered a stroke last year in the USA and is still on the road to recovery
