MINE workers and the Chamber of Mines will meet on Thursday to begin discussions over wage increments for the second quarter. The negotiations are being held amid a deepening economic crisis characterised by a crippling liquidity crunch, fuel and foreign currency shortages, low capacity utilisation and runaway inflation which stood at 676,39% for the month of March, eroding incomes and pensions. The coronavirus pandemic, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of fatalities, has further weakened the countryâ€™s battered economy.  Government imposed a national lockdown on March 30 to contain the spread of the virus which has since been extended twice and will end on Sunday. Associated Mineworkers Union of Zimbabwe president Tinago Ruzive yesterday said they would meet with the Chamber of Mines to discuss the second quarter wage increment in light of the continued skyrocketing of prices of basic commodities.
