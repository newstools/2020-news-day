BULAWAYO-based artiste Elton Sibanda has unveiled a new drama titled Ama2000, which focuses on religious parental guidance, sexuality, marriages, teenage pregnancies and drug abuse. BY SHARON SIBINDI The drama is set to be launched after the lockdown. The production was shot in Bulawayo central business district and Mpopoma. Sibanda — who wears different caps as a scriptwriter, television and theatre writer, director and actor — told NewsDay Life & Style that there was a generation gap between parents and children as a result of cultural dynamism. “I believe that the biggest problem Christian parents make is to impose religion on their children. Religion is a choice and it should be treated as such.  The film, therefore, advocates for proper communication within families when it comes to matters of religion and the realisation that both parents and children have responsibilities in this matter,” he said. Sibanda said the young generation is exposed to a lot of technology and information which shapes their world view differently from what is ordinarily expected. He said as an artist, he was using his work to educate the public on topical issues and to encourage behavioural change. Sibanda said Ama2000 was centred on a Christian family that breaks apart after the pastor’s children fail to appreciate Christianity and its benefits while the parents fail to comprehend the different societal pressures their children face.
 The cast includes Zenzo Nyathi, award-winning actresses Antoinette Sango and Charmaine Mudau, Sailas Matsika, Sean Matsamburutsa and Blessing Mazonde.
He said the objective of the drama is to initiate constructive dialogue within communities on matters of religion and the youth.
