ZIMDANCEHALL prodigy Tocky Vibes has disclosed that coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected a number of his projects including the production of his latest album, Dhongi Newaya, which had been scheduled for release on March 28. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA The Mhai hitmaker told NewsDay Life & Style that he was however hopeful that the album will make an impact once the COVID-19 curve has been flattened. “COVID-19 has affected us big time because we are no longer able to do shows since large gatherings were banned and that’s how we used to get money,” he said. “I was supposed to launch my new album on March 28, but this was affected by the outbreak. But we will wait until the situation returns to normalcy and release it.” Tocky believes the new album will make an impact after he roped in Progress Chipfumo, Ti Gonzi, Mathias Mhere and Amos Mahendere. “Although this (outbreak) has taken us by surprise, we are using the time to do other projects without rushing and I am glad that we had already set up a studio at home and we are working from home,” he said. The musician also urged his fans to buy his music online and subscribe to his YouTube channel. “Some of the music is on iTunes and that way, we will be able to continue giving our fans the best,” he said.
