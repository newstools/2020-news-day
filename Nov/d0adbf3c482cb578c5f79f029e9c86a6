BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Opposition FreeZim Congress leader Joseph Makamba Busha has said the country was not ready for a government of national unity (GNU), which he said would serve personal, rather than majority interests. Busha’s comments came after MDC-T interim leader Thokozani Khupe last week disclosed that she was pushing for a government of national unity with Zanu PF leader President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Speaking during his party’s policy conference held in the capital at the weekend, Busha said he did not believe in dialogue or transitional authority as most proponents of the idea were pursuing self-serving interests. “I have always been consistently saying I don’t believe in the idea of having dialogue, GNU or any transitional authority because most of the proponents are strategically locating themselves for positions and access to wealth,” he said. “They are doing so for personal aggrandisement not for the good of the generality of citizens.” As the country is facing a plethora of challenges ranging from the high rate of unemployment to a general dearth of service delivery, there have been calls for a GNU or transitional authority to extricate the country from this crises. Explaining his party’s mission, Busha said there was need to reduce the country’s 10 administrative provinces by half as a way of reducing government expenditure. “Once elected into office, FreeZim congress will have a lean government. The party will reduce the number of provinces to five to eliminate corruption, patronage, and Executive excess. It will invest heavily in research and development,” he said. “We emphasise on rule of law, property, and human rights. There will be economic hubs with functional in-country development projects. “Corporate tax will be reduced to 7%. There should be sustainable pension schemes. Territorial, socio-political and economic independence are key ingredients for success. Thus there is a need for employment creation.”
