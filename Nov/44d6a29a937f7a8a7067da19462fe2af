MUTARE City Council says it needs at least US$450 000 to complete the Dangamvura pipeline project that is said to be the panacea to the water problems in the suburb. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Dangamvura residents have endured water problems for several years. In an interview yesterday, council spokesperson Spren Mutiwi said the project was being stalled by financial challenges. “We now have all the required staff, but we still need more material and equipment. That hinges on council’s ability to secure US$450 000 which is required to complete the works,” he said. “Casting of piers or column is currently underway across Sakubva River. We are moving with pace to ensure that laying of pipes is done before the onset of the rainy season. “We are exhuming some of the pipes because they are not able to withstand high pressure since they are manual and leaving them will create problems in the shortest period,” he said. Mutiwi said funding was necessary if the project is to succeed, hence the need for ratepayers to pay their debts. “We are owed millions of dollars by ratepayers and we believe that once the debtors pay up, it will give impetus to the project.  We are committed to addressing the Dangamvura water shortages and to give our esteemed residents a dignified living standard that befits the urban set-up,” he said. l Follow Kenneth on Twitter
