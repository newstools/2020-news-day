FORMER Cabinet minister Nicholas Goche was yesterday removed from remand when he appeared at the Bindura Magistrates Court on charges of stealing 18 steers valued at US$18 000 from a Shamva farmer. BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE Goche (79) appeared before provincial magistrate Tinashe Ndokera. The complainant, Honest Mupanedengu, did not show up and was issued with a warrant of arrest. The State alleged on November 13, 2018, Goche sold 40 beasts to Mupanedengu who paid for the cattle through a bank transfer and collected 22 steers, leaving behind 18 steers. On an unknown date last year, Goche allegedly disposed of the 18 steers worth US$18 000 without Mupanedenguâ€™s consent. When Mupanedengu approached Goche to collect the remaining beasts, the ex-minister indicated that he had sold them, leading to his arrest.
