FORMER MDC-T national organising secretary Abednico Bhebhe has said the country should break from the past and commit to the future generations by ending Zanu PF hold on power. BY NIZBERT MOYO Bhebhe told NewsDay in an interview yesterdaythat the country now needed a fresh and able leadership without dictatorial tendencies which will uphold the rule of law. The MDC-T is planning to hold an extraordinary congress next month as mandated by the Supreme Court to deal with the leadership question. “We now have to boldly proclaim that it is time to break from the past and commit to future generations,” he said, adding that Zimbabwe required a fresh leadership without suspicious ties to dictatorship. “My advice to Zimbabweans is that they should persuade their relatives and friends who still believe there is hope that Zanu PF can fix what it has taken 40 years to destroy to back down from that stance.” Bhebhe said the nation should never imagine that with the current level of corruption, violence, non-respect of the rule of law and poor governance Zanu PF has the future of the country in their plans. The former organising secretary said human rights abuses, illegal detentions, torture and suspension of all forms of rights have all attracted the attention of the international world indicating that the world has responded by imposing targeted sanctions on the regime. He added that still the regime was poised to inflict more pain to the ordinary Zimbabweans. Bhebhe said the opposition lacked strategies to minimise infiltration by the regime, which he said was detrimental to the struggle for democracy in their 20 years of existence. Recently, the opposition party held Bulawayo provincial elections for presidential nominations, where Bhebhe reportedly secured Bulawayo nominations after trouncing four other candidates, among them acting president Thokozani Khupe and interim secretary Douglas Mwonzora.
