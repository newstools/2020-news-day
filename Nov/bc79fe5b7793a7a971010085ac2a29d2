Mashonaland East provincial police spokesperson Inspector Tendai Mwanza confirmed the incident. “We are appealing to members of the public who might have information on the whereabouts of the suspect to report to any nearest police station. Violence should never be an option and people should always find amicable ways to resolve their differences,” he said.
