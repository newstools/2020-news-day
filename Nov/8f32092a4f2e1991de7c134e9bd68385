BY WINSTONE ANTONIO FINANCE and Economic Development minister Mthuli Ncube this afternoon allocated $3.4 billion to the Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation sector during his 2021 budget presentation. Players in the arts sector are on record calling for financial backing from the government to create a conducive environment for the arts industry to thrive. They claim the government has to play a leading role in funding their activities so that they can catch up with their counterparts in the region and world at large. Arts stakeholders argue adequate funding of the sector would promote its growth as a potential contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP). Over the years, the government has continuously come under fire from arts stakeholders for its failure to bankroll the sector, leading to its failure to be transformed into a vibrant, professional and sustainable industry.
