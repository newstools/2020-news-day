POLICE in Bulawayo yesterday said they were still investigating a robbery case involving a Fawcett Security cash-in-transit (CIT) vehicle which was hijacked by armed robbers on Monday while it was transporting money from the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company premises to a local bank. BY NIZBERT MOYO National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said they were yet to establish the amount involved. “On November 2, the complainant was on duty at Fawcett offices and was tasked to escort money for banking at CBZ from Zupco offices in the company of his other three workmates,” Nyathi said. “Eight armed robbers with two pistols and a shotgun then ordered the Fawcett security guards to surrender the vehicle.” He said Fawcett guards drove along Plumtree Road to a CBZ Bank branch along 8th Avenue, entered the premises after being allowed in by their workmates who were manning the gate. “After the vehicle had entered the gate, the robbers then pushed the gate from outside and overpowered the guard. They bulldozed their way in, pointing guns and ordering the security guards to lie down before ordering them to surrender their guns,” Nyathi said. The robbers fled from the scene after loading the trunks into a black Mercedes-Benz and a small silver car. Nyathi said they also drove off with the Fawcett van before dumping it in Ilanda suburb. The gang allegedly went on to rob another man of his Nissan Hardbody vehicle. Nyathi said police later recovered the Nissan Hardbody and $11 305, adding that the total value that was stolen was yet to be ascertained.
