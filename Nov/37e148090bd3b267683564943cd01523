BY NIZBERT MOYO POLICE in Bulawayo are investigating a case involving an artisanal miner who died after he allegedly terrorised some female patrons at Skittle Inn in the central business district. The now deceased Thembelani Ndlovu (30), from Nhlobenje village in Jotsholo under chief Mabhikwa in Matabeleland North is said to have died during a drinking spree and after  he had harassed ladies of the night. Acting Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson assistant inspector Nomalanga Msebele confirmed the murder case. “On November 11 the now deceased Ndlovu from Nhlobenje village Jotsholo was brought to Bulawayo enroute Kennelworth, Inyathi by Fanuel Dube (50) from Bulawayo,” Msebele said. She said on the same day, Ndlovu, in the company of one Darlington Ndlovu who is Dube’s mechanic, visited Skittle Inn bar and started drinking beer. “Ndlovu then picked up fights with other patrons after grabbing ladies of the night without their consent,” she said. Msebele said Darlington left Ndlovu after failing to restrain him, and despite the fact that the two came to the bar together. The police spokesperson said the late Ndlovu failed to return home until the following day. Darlington then alerted Dube and the two launched a manhunt. Ndlovu was then found admitted at Mpilo Hospital with severe and critical head injuries. Msebele said hospital authorities revealed that Ndlovu was brought to the health institution after he was picked up by a well-wisher at Joshua Mqabuko Street along 10th Avenue where he was lying unconscious. The police spokesperson said the late Ndlovu succumbed to head injuries on Thursday, after doctors that attended to him discovered that he had a depressed skull fracture and a traumatic brain injury as a result of the assault. She said investigations on the matter are still underway.
