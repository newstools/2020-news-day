FORMER Cabinet minister Nicholas Goche, who was facing a stocktheft charge, was yesterday acquitted by Bindura magistrate Tinashe Ndokera. By SIMBARASHE SITHOLE Goche (79) was being accused of stealing 18 steers valued at $18 000. The State alleged that on November 13 2018, Goche sold 40 beasts to Honest Mupanedengu of Series Farm in Shamva. Mupanedengu paid for the cattle through a bank transfer and collected 22 steers, leaving behind 18 steers. On an unknown date last year, Goche allegedly disposed of the 18 steers without Mupanedenguâ€™s consent. When Mupanedengu approached Goche to collect the remaining beasts, the ex-minister indicated that he had sold them.
Carol Mupazviriwo represented the State.
