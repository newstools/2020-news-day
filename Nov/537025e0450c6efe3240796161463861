BY KENNETH NYANGANI PRIMARY and Secondary Education minister Cain Mathema has urged parents to report schools charging un-gazetted exorbitant fees to police. In an interview with NewsDay on Sunday, Mathema said journalists and parents should investigate and name all schools that were charging ungazetted fees. He said education was a collective responsibility and, therefore, everyone should stop schools from charging exorbitant fees. “Education is a collective thing, parents, guardians, chiefs and my ministry in fact everyone should work together and if there is a school that is charging extra fees, please report to the police, this is illegal,” he said. He also urged schools to engage in commercial activities to sustain themselves. “I encourage schools to engage in commercial farming activities to sustain themselves. Schools should be able to buy uniforms for their students, and this can be a relief to parents and guardians,” Mathema said. The Education minister added: “I will not accept a school that does not have electricity, I will not accept a school that does not have online learning, I will not accept a school that does not have a hectare of land and every school should produce good results.” Follow Kenneth on Twitter
