Yolanda Machiri (28) of Chitonho village is accused of trying to burn her husband Chamunorwa Shonhiwa (38), while he was inside the hut. The State led by prosecutor Edward Katsvairo alleged that on October 23 Machiri left her homestead, but returned home late at night. She had a misunderstanding with her husband who grilled her on why she came home late. Machiri then bolted out of the bedroom hut in anger and locked Shonhiwa inside before setting it on fire. Shonhiwa broke the door open and escaped. He sustained some burns on his back and lost a few valuables in the fire
.
Machiri is alleged to have scoffed at him, saying that he was lucky to have escaped. She was remanded in custody to   November 16. ÔÅ¨Follow Simbarashe on Twitter
