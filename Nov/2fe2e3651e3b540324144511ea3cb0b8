BINDURA town clerk Shangwa Mavesera (60) appeared before provincial magistrate Tinashe Ndokera yesterday facing three counts of abuse of office. By SIMBARASHE SITHOLE He pleaded not guilty and was granted $30 000 bail. Prosecutor Gossy Mudambu alleged that sometime in October 2018, Mavesera connived with council housing director Evelyn Madziire to sell a stand in the Bindura central business district measuring 4 773 square metres without a council resolution. Madziire is still at large. The duo knew that the stand had underground water pipes which rendered development on the stand impossible unless the pipes were rerouted. On October 26, they advertised the stand in a local newspaper and sold it for $431 537,50 to Roy Makumbe. Mavesera signed a memorandum of sale for the stand as proof of sale to Makumbe. In another case, it is alleged that he received an application letter for a private school stand from Richmond Magawu on February 19 which he approved illegally. Acting in connivance with Madziire, the duo favoured Magawu by selling him land which was reserved for a primary school. In March, the duo used the same modus operandi to favour Magawu by selling him a stand in Cleverhill which was reserved for a clinic without a council resolution. l Follow Simbarashe on Twitter
