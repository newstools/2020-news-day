A SENIOR investigating police officer yesterday told the court that Stephen Tserayi, one of the five accused persons in suspended Zimbabwe Miners Federation president Henrietta Rushwayaâ€™s gold smuggling case, tampered with exhibits and deleted some facts on the docket. BY MIRIAM MANGWAYA Rushwaya was arrested at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport last Monday for allegedly attempting to smuggle more than 6kg of gold to Dubai. Chief Inspector Michael Chibaya from Harare CID Law and Order, told Harare magistrate Ngoni Nduna during bail hearing that Tserayi, a Central Intelligence Organisation operative, connived with his accomplices to delete information where the First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa and her son, Collins, had been named as the owners of the gold which was being smuggled. He also said he failed to interview Collins because of protocols that needed to be followed when interviewing members of the First Family. Rushwaya is jointly charged with Pakistani businessman Ali Muhamad, Tserayi, Raphios Mufandauya and Gift Karanda on smuggling charges, illegal possession of gold, criminal abuse of office and defeating the course of justice.
