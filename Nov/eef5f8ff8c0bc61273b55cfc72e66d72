A 36-YEAR-OLD Bindura man who last week allegedly struck a senior citizen with an iron bar, killing him on the spot, has been arrested. BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE Bindura deputy police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Fidelis Dhewu confirmed the case. “We arrested Dugmore Chaitezvi (36) of Dunduru village in Bindura in connection with the death of Ignatious Dunduru (76) whom he allegedly assaulted with an iron bar all over the body,” Dhewu said. Allegations are that Chaitezvi stormed into the now-deceased’s house accusing him of stealing firewood. A misunderstanding arose and Dunduru took an iron bar from his bedroom hut for use in self-defence. The accused then wrested the iron bar from Dunduru and assaulted him. A neighbour, Chiedza Chagumuka (44) witnessed the assault and informed a nephew to the deceased that his uncle had been severely assaulted. The two rushed to the scene and found Dunduru dead. l Follow Simbarashe on Twitter
