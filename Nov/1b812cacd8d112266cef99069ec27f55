OPPOSITION MDC Alliance vice-presidents Tendai Biti and Lynette Karenyi-Kore and four other party leaders accused of violating COVID-19 regulations will stand trial on January 20, 2021 at the Harare Magistratesâ€™ Courts. BY MIRIAM MANGWAYA Biti, Karenyi-Kore, deputy secretary-general David Chimhini, national standing committee member Lovemore Chinoputsa, secretary for international relations Gladys Hlatywayo and Wongai Tome are being accused of violating COVID-19 regulations after they gathered in contravention of COVID-19 laws. The six, who are all out on bail, appeared before magistrate Esthere Chivasa yesterday. The opposition leaders were arrested in June this year after failing to access their offices at Morgan Richard Tsvangirai House which had been taken over by their rivals in the Thokozani-Khupe-led MDC-T. The police blocked them from entering the premises, and they protested, claiming ownership of the building, leading to their arrest. Meanwhile, magistrate Bianca Makwande will today make a ruling on an application by the State to have Harare West legislator Joanah Mamombe tried separately from her co-accused Cecilia Chimbiri and Netsai Marova in the alleged fake abduction case, since she (Mamombe) has not yet fully recovered from a mental ailment.
