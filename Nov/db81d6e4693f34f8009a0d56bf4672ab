BY PRAISEMORE SITHOLE UNITED Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) on Tuesday distanced itself from an ambulance reportedly stolen from the health institution and recovered in the city centre on Saturday night. The ambulance was reportedly stolen from UBH on Saturday last week. But UBH acting chief executive officer Narcisious Dzvanga on Tuesday said the ambulance in question was not theirs. He said the hospital’s ambulance fleet was all available and none had been stolen. “We do not own such an ambulance. The picture of the ambulance clearly shows that it is not our ambulance,” Dzvanga said. “Maybe it was from Mpilo Central Hospital or any others that own ambulances, but it is not one of ours.” Mpilo Central Hospital chief executive officer Solwayo Ngwenya said the ambulance did not belong to the institution. Dzvanga and Ngwenya’s statements came after the Information secretary Ndavaningi Mangwana posted on Twitter that an ambulance had been stolen from UBH. “This ambulance was stolen from UBH in Bulawayo last night (Saturday) around 9pm. It was fortunately recovered parked at Fort Street and no one was inside. Who does that?” Mangwana asked. lFollow Praisemore on Twitter @TPraisemore
