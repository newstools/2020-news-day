GLEN VIEW North MP Kennedy Dinar (MDC Alliance) has died. He was 42. BY HARRIET CHIKANDIWA Dinar died yesterday at Chitungwiza General Hospital where he was admitted after a short illness. MDC Alliance deputy spokesperson Clifford Hlatywayo confirmed the death, adding that the party had lost a dedicated cadre. “It is sad that we have lost a dedicated cadre, a loyal party member and a fighter for democracy,” Hlatywayo said. Dinar, a former student leader at the Harare Polytechnic, was elected MP in 2018 and was a teacher by profession. Party secretary-general Chalton Hwende said it was painful that the party had lost six national executive members, including two MPs in just two months. “In the last 60 days, we have lost six national executive members (two current MPs and two former MPs). Politics is increasingly becoming very risky in the so-called new dispensation. If you are not in court or jail then you are in the coffin,” Hwende tweeted.
