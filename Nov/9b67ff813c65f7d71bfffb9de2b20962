Churches have been urged to reflect on ethical issues and interpret them in the local context in order to address issues of gender-based violence (GBV) amid concerns there has been a 40% spike in cases during the COVID-19-induced lockdown. BY NIZBERT MOYO Shonia David Magurapira of the Anglican Church in Sakubva, Mutare, made the remarks during a roundtable discussion on GBV at Cresta Hotel in Bulawayo on Tuesday. The discussion came ahead of commemorations of this year’s 16 days of activism against gender-based violence, which kicks off on November 25 and run until December 10. “Pastors must move with time not to confine themselves to teachings from the Bible alone,” said Magurapira, adding that they should reflect on ethical issues and interpret them in the local contest. He said congregants needed practical solutions to the challenges than prayers alone, indicating that they can now pray and interpret the Bible at their homes using modern technologies, but pastors remain their focal persons to offer them practical solutions to their challenges. Magurapira said churches must speak out on issues of human rights abuses. Emthonjeni Women’s Forum programmes director Nomzamo Ncube said the discussion was a reflection of the progress made in denouncing violence against women which started in November last year and will end in September next year. On the issue of a Bill that seeks to address pregnancy of girls under 12 years among other issues, another participant, Deon Gombakomba said if the Bill is passed into law, it will address the consequences only leaving out causes and urged churches to take up the challenge and address the causes.
