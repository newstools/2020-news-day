A SUSPECTED sand poacher who was shot by Bulawayo City Council rangers two weeks ago has been buried. BY SILAS NKALA/ NIZBERT MOYO Thulani Dube (35) of St Peters, was shot by the rangers during a raid on suspected sand poachers at the defunct Mazwi Nature Game Reserves on the outskirts of Pumula high-density suburb. He succumbed to the gunshot wounds at the Mpilo Central Hospital. The deceased’s brother, Lungisani Tshuma, said he would ensure that the rangers that shot him are brought to book. “We laid him to rest today (Thursday) and we hope that justice will be done on the persons responsible for his death,” he said. Dube is survived by his wife and two minor children. Residents of St Peters expressed rage over his death, saying it had thrown his family into poverty. Bulawayo acting police spokesperson Inspector Nomalanga Msebele yesterday said the shooting incident happened between Mpopoma River and Methodist village in Pumula and investigations were underway. “On October 19, Cent Moyo was leading a team of five game rangers patrolling Mazwi Nature Game Reserve using a BCC-owned truck, Mazda B1800 vehicle,” she said. Msebele added that Moyo was armed with a pistol and on reaching Mpopoma River, they observed four men loading river sand onto a green seven-tonne Nissan UD truck. The acting police spokesperson said the suspected poachers were intercepted by council rangers, and Moyo fired two shots, one of which hit and injured Dube.
