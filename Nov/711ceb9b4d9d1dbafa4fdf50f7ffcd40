BY PHYLLIS MBANJE A HARARE woman who lost both legs after being run over by a Zupco bus when the driver lost control and rammed into cars and vendors at Mbare’s Mupedzanhamo market early last month, is struggling to pay her $60 000 hospital bills. Shamiso Muguto was admitted to Sally Mugabe Central Hospital in Harare and the hospital had at one time threatened to discharge her for failure to settle the bills. Her brother Archebold Muguto said the family later pleaded with the hospital to continue treating her. “The hospital seems to have heeded the calls for now and have started attending to her but the family is still concerned about the bills which are now over $60 000,” Muguto said. “The bus authorities have not been forthcoming with payment of bills and their insurance company has only said it will pay a paltry $2 000. After meeting the bus owners, they referred me to their insurance company, but there was no joy from them. They told me that they would pay according to the insurance package that Zupco is supposed to get,” he said. The family is appealing for help to settle the bills and other donations to cater for her needs. Sally Mugabe Central Hospital spokesperson Juliet Chikurunhe said: “I am not aware of the development. I will check with the doctors managing her to find out what is going on.”
