INNSCOR Africa has written to the Registrar of the Labour Court seeking the reinstatement of its case against the former southern region sales and marketing manager, Paul Chimboya, who is demanding US$308 000 damages in lieu of reinstatement. BY SILAS NKALA The case was struck off the roll after the parties reached a deadlock in out-of-court settlement negotiations. Chimboya was fired on December 27, 2017 on allegations of sabotaging the company, following the circulation of a letter deemed offensive to the firm. He then filed an application for quantification at the Bulawayo Labour Court seeking to be paid the sum of US$308 000 damages in lieu of reinstatement and US$91 000 as back pay, among other claims. However, following the removal of the case from the roll, the parties began out of court settlement negotiations in which the company offered to pay him $972 000. The company’s initial offer was $135 000, followed by $700 000 and then $972 000, all which Chimboya rejected demanding to be paid in United States dollars. Following the deadlock, the company through its lawyers from Ndove and Associates on November 4 wrote to the Registrar of the Labour Court seeking re-enrollment of the case. “We make reference to our court appearance on October 27, where in the matter was by consent of the parties removed from the roll to allow out of court negotiations. It has appeared that the parties have failed to agree on a settlement and by copy of this letter, we request that the matter be re-enrolled and set down for a hearing as the respondents require finality in this matter,” reads the letter. The parties are yet to receive a date from the court. Indications are that the company maintains its offer for an out-of-court settlement at $972 000 net from a gross of $1,3 million, while Chimboya stands by his demands of US$308 000 damages and
US$91 000 back pay.
