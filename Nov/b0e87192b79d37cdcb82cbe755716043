RESIDENTS of Emthunzini under Umguza Rural District Council have been threatened with eviction by a contractor, Hawk Flight Company after they failed to pay monthly installments which are in United States dollars. BY PRAISEMORE SITHOLE About 15 families have already been evicted for failing to pay the US$50 to US$150 monthly instalments for the rent to buy homes.
Some residents are said to have defaulted for four to five years. The affected residents who were interviewed by Southern Eye complained that despite the US dollar monthly instalments they pay, the contractor built sub-standard houses that can be easily affected by natural disasters. Blessing Makamu, a resident who is also leader of ward 16 Veterans of National Youth Service said the agreement they entered into was so stringent. He also said that for the past three years residents had been paying the United States dollar rentals, but those who defaulted for three months were evicted with no refunds. “Generally, the situation in Zimbabwe is bad because of the pandemic we are currently facing. “Every business is having its ups and downs and we expect the contractor to understand that we are unable to pay them United states dollars because he is also from Zimbabwe,” Makamu said. Another resident Taurai Mashanda said as of Thursday last week, 15 families had been evicted. Hawk Flight operations manager Martin Moyo said the residents were in huge arrears in terms of rentals. “They owe us a lot. The records are with the Messenger of Court for you to see. Some of the debts date back four to five years ago. “They have an alarming record of defaulting on rental payments. They have been issued with several eviction notices, and they only complain when it is the final notice,” Moyo said. In 2018, Plumtree Town Council sued Hawk Flight for failing to fully service residential stands.
