FOUR Vaima Arts Trust members, who are living with disabilities, have entered the world of literature after they published their debut Shona poetry book titled Tapinda Tapinda printed by Taffy Prints. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO The four are Rachel Madondo, Admire Takaindisa, Stellah Jongwe and Tinotenda Gweshengwe. Vaima Arts Trust director Kelvin Chikumbirike, who also authored some poems, told NewsDay Life & Style that the book’s title heralded the entry of people with disabilities (PWDs) into the literature world largely dominated by those with no disabilities. “The title of this Shona poetry book means we have entered. Indeed we have moved into an industry that has for long been dominated by people who are not physically-challenged. Poetry is an art which allows us to speak our mind, experiences, beliefs and values. The writers, therefore, manage to express themselves speaking out loud to the world,” he said. “I taught participants how to compose poems, they mastered the technique and got the book published. As Vaima we wanted to see the potential in our members, subsequently sending the message that disability doesn’t mean inability.” One of the writers Tinotenda Gweshengwe said working on the poems was not an easy journey. “Creating the poems was not easy and it was going to be more challenging without the help from Chikumbirike. I chose to be part of the project to speak to fellow PWDs and the nation at large. It’s also an illustration that we are able and motivates my colleagues,” he said. “My passion for arts grew when I was at high school. I used to do public speaking, recite poems and participated in drama clubs. After high school, Kelvin gave me the opportunity to take art to another step.”  Follow NewsDay on Twitter
