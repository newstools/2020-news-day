BY KENNETH NYANGANI Mutare Rural District Council chief executive Shepherd Chinaka has revealed that some council officials were illegally selling communal land as residential stands. Chinaka made the disclosure during the weekend at a Transparency International Zimbabwe (TI-Z) workshop on good governance. He said homeseekers must be wary and refuse to be sold communal land in areas such as Chitakatira and Odzi for the purposes of turning it into residential stands. “We are worried that people are being sold communal land as residential stands by some unscrupulous individuals, and we have since issued a statement in newspapers to stop people from buying such land,” Chinaka said. “Those that buy such communal land as residential stands will have their structures demolished because they are not following the correct procedures,” he said. TI-Z executive director Muchaneta Mundopa said the anti-corruption indaba in Mutare was being held against the backdrop of poor public service delivery in the country. “As TI-Z we strongly believe that citizen engagement is important in the development of cities and the country as a whole,” Mundopa said. She said non-availability of resources was partly to blame for the poor service delivery in the country, adding that there was need to strengthen accountability and transparency, as well as good governance in the use of public funds.
