MUSICIAN and comedian Mothusi Bashimane Ndlovu , popularly known as Madlela Skhobokhobo in the creative space, yesterday said he would never quit film production as it was the platform that catapulted him to limelight. BY SHARON SIBINDI Madlela was responding to fans’ concerns that he was slowly abandoning the film industry. “I have not quit film, I will never do that. That is my foundation that brought the Madlela brand to the people. Though we have not shot Madlela 5 yet, since it requires a lot, it is still in the pipeline and I hope soon all will be done,” he said. Madlela, who is also among this year’s Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAA) nominees, said besides music, he managed to survive during this COVID-19 pandemic through commercial advertisements for different companies. “I managed to sustain myself through film, in this case we were doing skits and adverts for different organisations. I have done adverts for CITE and I am their COVID-19 ambassador with Skhosana,” he said “I have also become the ambassador for KingdomBlue Life Insurance company based in South Africa and have done adverts for them encouraging people to have funeral policies and I do the same for a few non-governmental organisations,” he said. The SamaMoe hit-maker said they were still gathering resources to continue film production and urged his fans to be patient. “Production of a film requires a lot, we are still gathering resources for us to do a proper project. I think Madlela followers on the film side need to be patient a bit with me, it will be worthwhile I promise them,” he said. “I was in one of the celebrated movies Shaina and that alone, was a huge project for me.”  Follow Sharon on Twitter @SibindiSharon
