BULAWAYO’s poorly equipped COVID-19 isolation centres on Wednesday received a boost in fighting the pandemic from the Zimbabwe Christian Alliance (ZCA) which donated various hospital equipment. BY PRAISEMORE SITHOLE ZCA donated beds, sanitisers, water buckets and toiletries. Zimbabwe’s latest COVID-19 infection figures stand at 8 427, with 7 967 recoveries and 248 deaths. ZCA vice-chairperson Lucky Moyo in his remarks during the donation said: “We have been in partnership with the BCC [Bulawayo City Council] on various occasions and today the little that we brought will help the few who are in need in COVID-19 isolation centres.” Moyo said they were working with various district development officers to complement government efforts in providing for the needs of those in quarantine and isolation centres. “The church always has a role to play in the community and actively participates in community initiatives. Today’s donation comes at a time quarantine and isolation centres are struggling to acquire proper personal protective equipment for inmates,” Moyo said. Council spokesperson Nesisa Mpofu said: “Churches are the ones that can assist the city as they have the ability to create a difference. We are calling upon Christians to help Bulawayo to be a city on a hill and that is distinct which shows that God is alive.”
