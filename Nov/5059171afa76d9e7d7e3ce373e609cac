By Richard Muponde ZIMBABWE Miners Federation (ZMF) president Henrietta Rushwaya and her five co-accused in the 6kg gold smuggling case will today be back in court for continuation of their bail application, where the investigating officer Michael Chibaya is supposed to furnish the court with further reasons why they should be denied bail. Rushwaya is jointly charged with business partner Ali Mohammed, Central Intelligence Organisation operatives Stephen Tserayi and Raphios Mufandauya, police bosses Douglas Shoko, Edward Chimhungu and ZMF colleague Gift Karanda. The six were in court yesterday, but magistrate Ngoni Nduna adjourned the court to allow the investigating officer to file his reason to deny them bail. Rushwaya was arrested at the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport last Monday as she was about to fly to Dubai with the gold hidden in her hand luggage.
