A 30-YEAR-OLD Bindura man has been arraigned before the courts for allegedly trying to kidnap a girl who turned down his love proposal. BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE Augustine Chabwinja appeared before Bindura magistrate Moreblessing Makati on Monday facing criminal insult and attempted kidnapping charges. Prosecutor Edward Katsvairo alleged that in May, the complainant was sent to buy eggs from Chabwinja. Chabwinja asked for the complainantâ€™s name and address, but was only given the name without the address. He then followed the girl on her way back to see where  she stayed. A few days later, she returned to buy more eggs and Chabwinja then proposed love to her, but she refused. He then threatened to kidnap her if she continued to snub his proposal. It is also alleged that during the same month, Chabwinja met the complainant walking on the road. He tried to force her to get into his car. The complainant, however, managed to escape. She then told her mother about the incident, who accompanied her to the police station to make a report, which led to his arrest.
The matter was remanded to November 16.
