THE late popular actor and comedian Lazarus “Gringo” Boora, who succumbed to cancer on Monday morning at a private health institution in Harare has laid to rest at his rural home in Rukweza, Rusape. Scores of mourners, among them, National Arts Council of Zimbabwe director Nicholas Moyo, Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation deputy minister Tino Machakaire, comedian Kapfupi and Simon Mutambi gathered to bid farewell to the veteran entertainer. Gringo’s acting career began when he appeared on a TV commercial for Castle Lager. Later on, he worked for the now defunct Joy TV where he appeared on some TV shows. He carved his name with the popular drama series Gringo, where he shared the platform with one of the country’s best actresses, the late Sthembeni Makawa. Gringo was arguably one of the best actors of his generation as he played the role of a notorious gardener who used unscrupulous means to “fix” his errors. He is survived by wife Netsai Meki and seven children. More details to follow…..
