BY SHARON SIBINDI SUNDUZA Dance Theatre (pictured) has revived its late 1990s production, Injabulo 2000, making it relevant to today’s generation, with the new production set for premiere in April at the Bulawayo Theatre. Injabulo 2000 is a production that tells the story of a young musician who went looking for work at the mines in South Africa. Produced by the groups’ long-term producer Philip Weiss, the play employs a wide range of dances, colourful costumes and masks. Sunduza director Charles Banda yesterday told NewsDay Life & Style that Injabulo 2000 was part of the production they would offer to their fans as they celebrate 35 years in the arts industry. “This is not a new production for Sunduza, we once performed Injabulo 2000 at Edinburgh Festival and at the Vancouver Children’s Festival in Canada. The production is unique as it displays how the old members did it during their time and then how us, the third generation, roll it out,” he said. “We will be celebrating our 35th anniversary in the arts industry, so that is the most motivational thing that made us prepare this production. It was done in the 1990s in preparation for the year 2000.” Banda said they would also do a video shoot for the production and plans were afoot to showcase it in China, but it has been affected by the deadly coronavirus which has killed thousands of people in that country. “We have created our own Injabulo as a new third generation of Sunduza. You know our generation, we are taking it to another level flowing with the modern times,” he said. “We were looking at taking the production outside the country, showcasing it at the children’s Assitej China festival in June, but now it’s not going to happen due to (the coronavirus).”
