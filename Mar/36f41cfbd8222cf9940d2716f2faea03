BY TERRY MADYAUTA FC PLATINUM gaffer Heindrikus Pieter de Jongh has issued a warning to Premier Soccer League rivals that his team will only get better after the miners swaggered their way to a Castle Challenge Cup triumph over Highlanders on Saturday. The Zvishavane-based side was quite impressive in the way it dispatched Bosso and proved why it’s one of the title favourites even before any ball has been kicked in the 2020 campaign. The Dutchman declared that he will win more trophies for the Zvishavane side after outwitting his former paymasters. “It’s just the beginning of better things for the club. The team is now moving as a unit and we are going to improve and become even more stronger,” he said. “I only used a fringe of my new players; the other ones will play when the league starts.” De Jongh said his sights were on the CAF Champions League where the platinum miners have been struggling to make real impact. Silas Songani who notched a brace in the challenge cup seems to have given De Jongh a measure of confidence that they will do better in the premier club competition set for August. “This is a sign that we are on a good route. When your player manages to score one or two good goals, you see that nothing can stop us from getting what we wish for if we work for it,” he added. Out of 12 new signings, only five players played against Highlanders. Sizzling Songani was at his best, giving a glimpse of what he can provide while Ralph Kawondera was at his penetrative best in his box-to-box exploits. Former Manica Diamonds forward Stanley Ngala was also sterling. Tanzanian striker Elias Maguri and former Highlanders star Denzel Khumalo were introduced late into the game.
