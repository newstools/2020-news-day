GOSPEL musician Mathias Mhere yesterday said his ninth album Talita Kumi was ready and it would be launched on December 13 at Harare Gardens subject to the police’s response to their application to hold the launch in line with COVID-19 protocols. BY LIFE & STYLE CORRESPONDENT Mhere told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that they wrote to the police seeking clearance to proceed with the launch and they were expecting a response today. The Favour hitmaker said the album’s title track inspired by the biblical story of a young girl brought back to life by Jesus, was influenced by the hardships that people have gone through during the COVID-19 era. “We have gone through tough times because of COVID-19 and many have lost hope while some believers have backslidded as there were no church gatherings for a long time, so I was saying arise from that situation and move forward,” he said. Mhere said while it did not make economic sense to release an album at a time people’s incomes had been depressed due to the economic difficulties emanating from the COVID-19 lockdown, as gospel musicians they were duty-bound to inspire people. “We have to give them hope, strengthen their faith. “It’s not about making money, but spreading the word of God and giving people hope. That is why we are releasing the album during these tough times,” he said. Mhere said tracks to look forward to from the album include Hupenyu HwaLazaro, Pamusha waJobho, Sunga Moyo Pakunamata, Matarenda, Mukombe Uyu, Baba naMai and Munhu Yeuka Uri Huruva.
He said on some of the tracks he collaborated with fellow artistes such as dancehall singer Killer T, Chelsea Mguni and Blessing Shumba.
