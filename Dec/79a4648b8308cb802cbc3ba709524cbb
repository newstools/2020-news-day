Spain has surpassed the milestone of 50,000 deaths officially attributed to COVID-19. The Spanish health ministry said Monday the number of victims has reached 50,122. Spain has recorded almost 1.88 million cases of the new coronavirus among its population of 47 million. Nationwide restrictions on movement and curfews in recent weeks have helped the country slow COVID-19’s spread. The country’s 14-day case rate per 100,000 inhabitants stands at 246, down from a peak last fall of 529, recorded on Nov. 9. The health ministry says that just over 21% of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients are occupied. Spain began its national vaccination program on Sunday, at homes for the elderly. – AP
