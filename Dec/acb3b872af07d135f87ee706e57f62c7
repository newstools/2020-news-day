Bitcoin is a new currency developed in 2009 by an anonymous individual using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. There are no middlemen – that’s not banks! Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on Expedia, to browse for overstock furniture, and to purchase Xbox games. Yet a lot of the buzz is about making money by investing. Bitcoins can be used to purchase products anonymously. In comparison, foreign transfers are simple and cheap, since bitcoins are not bound by any government or subject to legislation. Small companies may prefer them and there are no costs for credit cards. Some people just buy bitcoins as an investment, hoping they’re going to be worth it. Many markets called “bitcoin exchanges” encourage people to buy or sell bitcoins using various currencies. Coinbase, along with Bitstamp and Bitfinex, is a leading exchange. Yet stability may be a concern: tens of millions of dollars of bitcoins were stolen from Bitfinex when it was compromised in 2016.  Bitcoins are kept in a “digital wallet” that resides either in the cloud or on a user’s device. The cryptocurrency is a virtual bank payment system that allows users to transfer or receive bitcoins, pay for purchases, or store their money. In comparison to bank accounts, bitcoin wallets are not protected by the FDIC. If every bitcoin exchange is recorded in the public ledger, the names of buyers and sellers are never disclosed—only their wallet IDs. While this makes the transactions of Bitcoin users confidential, it also helps them to buy or sell things without easily connecting it back to them. This is why it has become the currency of preference. We’ve seen from the online response that so many people are involved in making money from automated cryptocurrency bitcoin exchanges.
