HIGHLANDERS defender Andrew Mbeba is excited at the opportunity to fight for a place in the squad that will play at the African Nations Championship (Chan) finals in Cameroon next month. BY FORTUNE MBELE The Chan finals were supposed to be played in April but was put on ice due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will now be played next month. Before the finals were postponed, Warriors’ coach Zdravko Logarusic had announced a squad which had gone into camp in March and the young Mbeba was not part of that squad.
Mbeba (20), the 2019 Castle Rookie of the Year, is hopeful of making it to the final squad to travel to Cameroon. “I am nervous but happy at the same time. I am happy for the recognition by the coaches. What it means is I have to work hard to prove I am worth it,” Mbeba said. The young central defender who has since established himself at Highlanders, partnering Peter Muduhwa, believes the Chan finals are a big stage where one can attract attention for bigger opportunities. “I have to go to Cameroon. I have to prove myself and make it to the final squad that travels. It will be good exposure since like every other player I also have ambitions of playing outside the country even if it means going straight to England.” The Warriors have begun preparations for the tournament, where they will play Cameroon in the curtain raiser, with 34 players having been called up. Six FC Platinum players have been excused following their Caf Champions League preliminary round matches against Costa dol Sol. They now shift focus to the first round tie against Simba Stars of Tanzania as they bid for a Group stage berth. Follow Fortune on Twitter @fmbele
