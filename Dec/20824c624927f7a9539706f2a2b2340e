BY ARTS REPORTER UNITED KINGDOM-BASED award-winning gospel musician Obert Maziwisa  has dropped a single track titled Count Your Blessings in which he seeks to restore hope on believers during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The song that features the daughter of revered gospel diva Ivy-Kombo Kasi, Sammy-Joe as the backing vocalist is already on online music platforms like Amazon among others. The Gokwe-born musician, famed for the song Komborerai Mafaro, said despite challenges the song was therapy to God’s people during times of afflictions. “I acknowledge that in the year 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many lost their jobs and some lost their loved ones. “Despite all that, we must not forget to be thankful for the gift of life, shelter, family and many more blessings that we have. Be thankful and count your blessings despite life’s challenges and setbacks,” he said. The track was taken off the album, Thankful that is yet to be released due to the restrictions associated with the pandemic as well as financial constraints. The launch of the song however, marks the return of the energetic musician after a three-year sabbatical. Maziwisa, who has worked with a number of local musicians last did the song Dhuma Dhuma in 2017 that features celebrated musician Bethany Pasinewako-Ngolomi. “We resolved to release one song after the other, of all the songs on the album Thankful that was recorded live. Our gospel music fans should expect another song soon,” he added. Thankful was recorded in 2018 during a sold-out show in the UK. Some of his albums include Munhu Chii? (2002), Come Along (2010) and I Fly Higher (2014). Maziwisa has won several accolades among them the Zim Achievers Award.  Follow us on Twitter @newsdayzimbabwe
