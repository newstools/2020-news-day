CHAIRPERSON of the Women and Gender Parliamentary Portfolio Committee Chido Madiwa yesterday said unfair distribution of power is influencing cases of gender based violence (GBV) in the country. BY HARRIET CHIKANDIWA She said this during a virtual discussion by the Parliament of Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwe Television Network (ZTN). “Unequal distribution of power and resources together with cultural practices influence issues of violence in society and communities,” Madiwa said. “The coming up with a Zimbabwe Gender Commission is one of our efforts to fight GBV. “The legislation has been very effective in dealing with issues of GBV, and the reported cases that have been dealt with which involve issues of violence show that there has been improvement and awareness has helped victims to report cases of violence,” she said. MDC Alliance legislator Jasmine Toffa (proportional representation) said MPs must use their role in Parliament to tackle issues of violence within communities. Toffa has been a victim of verbal GBV abuse in Parliament, together with Harare West MP Joanna Mamombe (MDC Alliance).
