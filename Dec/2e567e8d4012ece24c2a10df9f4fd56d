PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) chief executive Kennedy Ndebele says the letters which he wrote to the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) and the World League Forum which riled Zifa were an instruction from his superiors. BY FORTUNE MBELE Ndebele has been accused by Zifa of authoring letters to the two sports bodies, which it alleges undermined its authority. Contents of the letters could not be ascertained by this publication. The PSL supremo has been asked to retract the two letters by Zifa. However, in his response, Ndebele said he was acting on behalf of the league’s governors and could not be crucified in his personal capacity. “I acknowledge receipt and thank you for your letter dated November 18. I note the letter was addressed to me in my personal capacity. I would like to advise that I am employed by PSL and all decisions have been performed and taken for on behalf of the PSL. I have since forwarded your letter to the governors for advice and guidance,” Ndebele wrote to Zifa. Allegationsare that Ndebele gave interviews in the media between August and September, and Zifa felt that some of his utterances were demeaning and were meant to bring the game of football into disrepute. Ndebele complained about the COVID-19 financial bailout that his organisation had received as well as the delay in the resumption of football. He is also accused of writing to SRC and World League Forum without the authority of Zifa who are the country’s football governing body. PSL falls under the Zifa purview. Zifa also said Ndebele has not furnished then with clubs financial accounts as requested.  Follow Fortune on
