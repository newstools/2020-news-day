BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) – Argentina on Wednesday became the first major country in Latin America to legalize abortion when the Senate voted by 38 in favor to 29 against with one abstention to approve a bill allowing the procedure through the 14th week of pregnancy, bucking the traditionally strong influence of the Catholic Church in the region. The contentious vote followed a marathon debate that began at 4 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Tuesday. – Reuters
