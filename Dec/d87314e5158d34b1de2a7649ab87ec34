by JAIROS SAUNYAMA THE long-awaited burial of Murewa boy Tapiwa Makore, which had been slated for January 9, has once again been put on hold after the family resolved to intensify the search of the missing head. Recently, the family with the blessing of traditional leader Chief Mangwende resolved to bury the remains of the slain seven-year-old next month before the resolution was overturned yesterday. The Makore family lawyer Tabitha Charlene Chikeya said the burrial had been put on hold. “The family has put the burial on hold for now. They want to keep searching for the missing parts. The date (January 9) has been cancelled,” she said.
Tapiwa was murdered in September for suspected ritual purposes. His body was chopped into pieces. Among the suspects arrested in connection with the murder are his uncles and namesake Tapiwa Makore, Thanks Makore and herdsman Tafadzwa Shamba. Through their lawyer the family wrote to police Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga asking for DNA forensic test results which confirmed that some body parts found in the vicinity belonged to the deceased. The boy’s head is still missing with police still investigating to establish its whereabouts.
