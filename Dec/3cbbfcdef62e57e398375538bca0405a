BY FORTUNE MBELE HIGHLANDERS Football Club yesterday honoured the late Adam “Adamski” Ndlovu, by presenting the number 13 home shirt to his family. Adam died in a traffic accident on his way to Victoria Falls on December 16 2012. His brother, who was driving, the legendary former Warriors skipper Peter survived the accident. The jersey was received by their elder brother Madinda at a function to launch the selling of Highlanders 2021 replica jerseys in Bulawayo yesterday. Highlanders chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube said the gesture would be made for all the Highlanders players who passed on over the years. “Those that have passed on for instance Adam Ndlovu whose anniversary of passing on was yesterday (Wednesday) we have decided to honour him by doing a jersey which we hand over to the family. We will also progressively do the same for others who have passed on,” Dube said. Highlanders kit for 2021 is sponsored by ORB Looks.
