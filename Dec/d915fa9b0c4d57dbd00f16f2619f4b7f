They allegedly said: “Comrades Zimbabwe has never been ripe for revolution at any given time than now. It is our time to revolt against this government because I can say this clearly that Emmerson Mnangagwa and (former health minister) Obadiah Moyo, maitiro avo ndeekuparadza isu (their conduct is meant to destroy us).” They also allegedly said that Mnangagwa and Moyo’s conduct lacked wisdom and was aimed at destroying Zimbabwe, adding that a revolt was necessary because citizens had been deprived of a brighter future.

Mnangagwa fired Moyo on July 8, after he was charged with corruption over illegally awarding a multi-million-dollar contract for medical equipment.
