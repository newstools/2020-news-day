UMKHATHI Theatre Works founder Matesu Dube said in an effort to showcase theatre for young audiences they would hosts a virtual Bulawayo children’s festival (Bulawayo ChildFest) to be headlined by both local and international acts on December 19 in line with global COVID-19 restrictions. BY SHARON SIBINDI In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, Dube said the festival would encompass dance, drama, and storytelling. “We were meant to host the festival this November after doing a pilot that was supported by CREDISI last year. “We came up with the idea for this festival after realising that we don’t have a festival that is solely meant for young audiences where children and adults perform for children,” he said. “The only available platforms for children’s performances are competitions where most children go home angry after losing in a competition.” Dube said through the annual festival, they sought to cultivate a young theatre audience that would grow up with a culture of attending theatre shows, adding that they were inviting partners for the project. “Umkhathi Theatre Works will present a three-man play titled Zaza and Zozo, Gift Chakuvinga will present a storytelling act, so as Georgian Keable from Norway. “Marimba Manglar from Ecuador will present dance and music while a five-year-old boy, Inaki Blanco Saenz from Mexico will present The Adventures of the Penguin,” he said.
