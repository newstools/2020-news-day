PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa will tomorrow visit Kakora Primary School in Mazowe for this year’s National Tree Planting Day. By SIMBARASHE SITHOLE Mazowe Rural District Council chairperson John Mudzonga said they would follow all the COVID-19 protocols. “We are ready for the President and we are all excited to host him. All the COVID-19 protocols have been put in place,” Mudzonga said. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen if Mnangagwa will make it this time to the province as he has cancelled all his scheduled programmes at the eleventh hour.
Zanu PF district co-ordinating committee (DCC) elections are scheduled for tomorrow. The ruling party’s provincial spokesperson Alfred Mufunga confirmed Mnangagwa’s visit. “We are going to host President Mnangagwa on Saturday in Mazowe,” he said. Mnangagwa has only visited Mashonaland Central province once this year when he officiated at the Bindura University of Science Education graduation ceremony last month.
Mnangagwa has in the past aborted several meetings in Mashonaland Central province due to poor attendance, despite bagging all the 18 parliamentary seats in the province. Follow us on Twitter @NewsDayZimbabwe
