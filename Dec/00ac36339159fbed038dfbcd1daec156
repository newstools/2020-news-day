THE National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC) yesterday began provincial consultative meetings in Bulawayo to gather people’s views on how best to address the country’s dark past such as Gukurahundi. By NQOBANI NDLOVU Critics argue that the NPRC was not acting on resolutions made at consultative meetings to address past human rights abuses. However, the NPRC denies the charges, insisting that the meetings were of significance. In a notice yesterday, the Information ministry said NPRC would hold provincial consultative meetings for Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and South beginning today (yesterday) until Sunday. “The NPRC will hold a series of provincial consultative meetings in Bulawayo under the topic: Healing, Reconciliation and Rehabilitation,” the notice read in part. Today, the NPRC will be meeting Matabeleland North stakeholders, on Saturday it will be in Matabeleland South and in Bulawayo on Sunday. The term of office for NPRC commissioners expires in February 2021. The Parliamentary Committee on Standing Rules and Orders has since called on the public to nominate persons to be considered for appointment as members of the commission, whose five-year term expires in February 2021. Parliament has set today as the deadline to receive the nominations. The process, however, does not affect the position of the current chairperson Selo Maselo Nare, who was sworn-in in March 2018. Nare took over from the late former Speaker of Parliament Cyril Ndebele. Established under sections 251 to 253 of the Constitution, critics argue that the commission has failed in its mandate to ensure post-conflict hearing and reconciliation, particularly with regards to the mass killings in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces in the 1980s.
