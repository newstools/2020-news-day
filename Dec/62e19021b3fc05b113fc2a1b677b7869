A MYSTERIOUS fire on Saturday morning razed down the homestead of Thanks Makore, a suspect in the murder of 7-year-old Tapiwa Makore, in Nyamutumbu area in Murewa. Thanks, is also a twin brother to Tapiwa Makore (Snr), who is currently in remand prison for allegedly ordering the death of the boy allegedly for ritual purposes. When NewsDay visited the homestead, a kitchen hut and a gazebo had been reduced to ashes with police investigating the incident. The fire occurred after Makore had been granted $10 000 bail by Justice Tawanda Chitapi in Harare. The fire also follows another incident in which Tapiwa Makore (Snr) had his kitchen hut gutted by fire recently. A neighbour and Makore’s elder brother Shadrack said he was alerted of the incident by his nephew Shaw Munanga. “My nephew who stays at Thanks’ homestead woke me up at around midnight telling me that the home was on fire. I woke up and noticed that the hut and gazebo were being destroyed by the raging fire. “It is shocking.  Remember it is barely a month since we witnessed my brother Tapiwa’s hut being destroyed in an inferno,” he said. Efforts to get a comment from Mashonaland East provincial police spokesperson Inspector Tendai Mwanza were fruitless yesterday. However, a team of police officers from the Central Investigations Department forensic department were at the homestead on Saturday. lFollow Jairos on
