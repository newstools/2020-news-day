JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC) has cancelled its January 8th commemoration amid growing COVID-19 concerns. The party said that its president, Cyril Ramaphosa, would read a statement to be broadcast on media platforms. The decision was taken following a briefing with Health Minister Zweli Mkhize cautioning about the possible spread of COVID-19. This year’s event was meant to take place in Limpopo and it had been decided that only 100 hundred people would be allowed to attend the main celebration. – Eyewitness News
