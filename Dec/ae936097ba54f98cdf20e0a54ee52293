THE National Aids Council (Nac) has called on church leaders and traditional healers to raise awareness with their members and clients on issues to do with tuberculosis (TB). By SIMBARASHE SITHOLE This issue was raised by Nac last Thursday at a meeting at Mazowe Hotel attended by health experts, church leaders and traditional healers. Nac Mashonaland Central provincial manager Edgar Muzulu said in order to effectively fight TB, the influence of church leaders and traditional healers was pivotal as they wielded power within their communities. “TB is a menace in the province, hence, we have realised that traditional healers and church leaders wield power in their communities, so they are the right people to help us in raising awareness on the respiratory disease,” he said. Muzulu urged traditional healers to refer TB patients to hospitals for further treatment. Mashonaland Central provincial chairperson for the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association (Zinatha) Rosemary Mushamba said: “As Zinatha, we have learnt that prevention is the cheapest method of TB treatment, hence we should prevent the spread of TB. When we treat our patients, we should also refer them to hospital for further treatment.” A representative of the Johane Marange Vapostori sect Anesu Hayerera said: “At our church, we are not allowed to access treatment at hospitals, but the biggest lesson I learnt here is to fight TB stigma. I will share those lessons with my colleagues.” A Zimbabwe Council of Churches representative Edgar Zirumba said churches should discuss the issue of fighting diseases in the country.
