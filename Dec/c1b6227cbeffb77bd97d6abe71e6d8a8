PARIS — Thiago Mendes received a red card during Lyon’s 1-0 win away at Paris Saint-Germain last weekend for a poor tackle on Neymar (pictured) that damaged the Brazilian forward’s ankle, which has led to the midfielder’s family receiving death threats. Neymar was stretchered-off and was in tears, with the thought at the time that the 28-year-old could be set for an extended spell on the sidelines. However, PSG’s medical team have confirmed that nothing serious occurred and he could even feature against Lille on Sunday night. “Mistakes do happen, but I am here to offer Neymar my sincerest apologies. I hope it is not serious,” Mendes said. That was not enough for some radical fans, though, as they threatened his family, as the player’s wife, Kelly, told 20 Minutes France. On social media, there were direct death threats. “If something happens to Neymar, you will pay with your life. You and your family, one by one,” one message sent to Kelly Mendes read. She will report the messages to the police. — Marca
