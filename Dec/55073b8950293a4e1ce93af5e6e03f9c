FORMER Black Rhinos midfielder Gift “Guava” Kamuriwo will be laid to rest at Glenforest Cemetery in Harare tomorrow afternoon. By Sports Reporter Former Black Rhinos secretary Wellington Mabhiginye said burial has been scheduled at 2pm. Kamuriwo, who also played for the Warriors, having horned his skills at the now-defunct Mhangura before becoming team manager of the army side at the end of his career, succumbed to meningitis at the 2 Brigade Hospital on Tuesday. The midfielder, who was 46, has been unwell since the beginning of the year. Affectionately known as Guava in football circles, Kamuriwo started his football career at Mhangura before coming to the capital to join army side Black Rhinos where he banged 16 goals to win the Golden Boot in 2002. He helped the club to a second position finish that year and was voted first runner up for the Soccer Stars of the Year. The former Black Rhinos captain also played for the Warriors having been called up to the national team in 2003. He also participated in the Confederation Cup in which they lost to Morocco’s Raja Casablanca. However, an ankle injury sustained in 2004 cut-short his career. He went into coaching in 2012 taking charge of Seven Flames, a second division side. He also had a stint as assistant coach at Cranborne Bullets Football Club.
