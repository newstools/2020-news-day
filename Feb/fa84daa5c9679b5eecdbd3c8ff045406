BY SINDISO DUBE UMAHLEKISA Comedy Club, the organisers of the forthcoming Men’s Conference, says the programme was not designed to give men an opportunity to dodge Valentine’s Day, which comes with spending and spoiling loved ones. The conference will be held from February 14 to 16, at a venue yet to be disclosed, but in Matopos, Matabeleland South province, coinciding with Valentine’s Day and was designed to equip men with life skills such as grooming, health, courtship and relationships. Umahlekisa Comedy Club founder Ntando Van Moyo said the inaugural event was designed to equip men. “The conference is not a way to dodge Valentine’s Day as we all know that it’s a leap year, so it’s the women’s responsibility to make sure that we are spoilt, as their men. This is our first time hosting such an event and we are excited with the response we have been getting from men in and outside Bulawayo,” he said. “It’s something we considered doing as a way to get men together as they rarely have time alone, away from the busy day-to-day schedules and also away from women who have plenty of conferences. We figured out that men are always stressed in life and never get time to relax and get to learn more about life.” Taking to micro-blogging site Twitter, South African producer and wheelspinner Prince Kaybee announced that he was interested in attending this year’s conference. “I think I might be heading to the Men’s Conference, you guys need good music there? I can bring alcohol too,” he tweeted.
