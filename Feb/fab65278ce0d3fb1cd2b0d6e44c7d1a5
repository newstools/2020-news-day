BY Kevin Mapasure One of Zimbabwe’s top bodybuilding athletes Tinotenda Gumbo is targeting attaining an International Federation of Body Building and Fitness pro card this year after lining up to compete at a number of events outside the country. Gumbo, who has bagged 10 medals in his career, is preparing for the Arnold Classic where he hopes to clinch gold in the Men’s Physique section. The 26-year-old can attain a pro card if he manages to win gold at the Arnold Classic that will be held in South Africa this May. Later this year, Gumbo is targeting the Mr Olympia Amateur competition which will be held in Colombia. Gumbo is seeking sponsorship so that he can prepare for the international competitions, but is currently getting support from Trysupps Zimbabwe, who are providing supplements, as well as Fitness First Gym where he trains at no cost. The dietary part is the most expensive part of his training where he will need to stick to a special diet for 12 weeks as he targets a rippled mid-section.
He is also seeking a ticket for his trip to South Africa. He said turning professional would be a dream come true for him, having finished second in his first competition, Mr n Ms Novice, won gold at the Mr ZITF 2017 in the Men’s Physique category as well as finishing number one in the Marume Classic the same year and in the same category. He has previously won gold in the men’s category of the Mr Zimbabwe. “Competing outside the country and turning pro would be a dream come true for me,” Gumbo said. “I am currently preparing for this year’s events at the Fitness First gym and right now we are focusing mainly on bulking up for the next five weeks. From there I will go into a 12-week dietary regime, which is the most expensive part of the whole exercise. I am working hard to improve on some of my weaker points mainly my calves as well as widening my back and achieve a smaller waist line and I want to get into the competition with a more rippled mid-section.”
