BY CHELSEA MUSAFARE PRODUCERS of a new local series, Chipo the Gift, which touches on diverse contemporary issues have added more life to the showbiz with a television series which premiered yesterday on ZBC-TV. Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style yesterday, one of the producers, Peter Churu, said their latest 13-episode project was thought-provoking. The film traces the life of a young girl called Chipo, who is about to be married off as a child bride, dashing her dreams for education. “She starts exploring other options and without warning, disaster strikes followed by betrayal from those she held closest to her heart. In a colourful story of life and survival, religion finds itself standing eyeball to eyeball with the law,” Churu said. The series co-producer, Virginia Jekanyika (pictured), said the film, which was launched in October last year during Women Wine and Words Festival at Theatre in the Park, was produced by Rooftop Promotions in collaboration with the Zimbabwe Women Lawyers Association (ZWLA). “The film is based on real cases which were supplied to us by ZWLA a partner in the production of the drama. They gave me a number of court cases they deal with and I deduced the main themes from there and came up with a storyline which encompassed a lot of those true events,” she said. The over 40-member cast film will enlighten and empower women on issues concerning justice. The film’s soundtracks were done by afro-fusion singer Ashton “Mbeu” Nyahora, who said it was an honour to work with renowned filmmakers and
directors.
