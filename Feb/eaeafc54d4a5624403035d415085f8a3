BY TERRY MADYAUTA FORMER TelOne goalkeeper Raphael Pitisi is set to join South Africa’s National First Division outfit Tshakuma Tsha Madzivhandula. The rookie goalkeeper left TelOne at the end of last season, following the expiry of his contract, after the WiFi Boys were relegated. But after an impressive maiden  season in the topflight where he kept nine clean sheets, which earned him a call up to the Young Warriors squad, he captured the interest of the South African outfit while locally Triangle were also in pursuit of his signature. Pitisi was a top contender for the 2019 Rookie of the Year award which was eventually won by Highlanders’ Andrew Mbeba. However, the 19-year-old is set to put pen to paper this afternoon in South Africa, having already agreed in principle to join the lower tier team, Tshakuma Tsha Madzivhandula. “I have been trying my luck here (South Africa) and we have agreed terms with the club. As scheduled, we should complete the deal tomorrow (today). It’s a Division One club, but its better off compared to our own Division One,” Pitisi told the NewsDay Sport.  He joins a number of players who dumped TelOne upon relegation, among them Emmanuel Mandiranga, who is currently training with Harare City. Soccer Star of the Year finalist King Nadolo is on his way out, while talented right back Marvelous Chigumira is trying his luck in Russia. The pair of Emmanuel Zinyama and Innocent Zambezi were recalled by their parent club Harare City.
