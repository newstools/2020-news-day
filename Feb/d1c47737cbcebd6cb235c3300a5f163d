BY WINSTONE ANTONIO VICTORIA FALLS-BASED arts promoter Paul “Elder” Shambare, of Express Entertainment, has urged fellow promoters and organisations to channel some resources towards Zimdancehall, which he said had unearthed untapped talent across the country. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style yesterday, Elder Shambare praised some local dancehall artistes for the creativity they exhibited when they combined their voices on the recently released riddim named after him, which was produced by Marlon T. Riddim is the Jamaican patois pronunciation of the English word “rhythm”. “As a way of promoting Zimdancehall, Express Entertainment is going to finance a number of projects as we have done with the Elder Shambare Riddim to support the industry. We might be based in Victoria Falls, but we promise that we will continue to support musicians from all the regions,” he said. “It is important for upcoming musicians to utilise opportunities such as recording on riddims because it gives them the platform to collaborate with established musicians. If you look at the Elder Shambare Riddim, we have both upcoming and established musicians on one project. This helps them to get to know each other, explore business opportunities in their genre.” If conversations on different social media platforms are anything to go by, the riddim is credited for at least bringing back Silent Killer and Hwindi President to the limelight as they are considered to have brought the spark to the riddim. The chanters have been on top of their game lately, producing top-notch songs. Marlon T hailed Elder Shambare’s support for Zimdancehall, claiming that the idea of riddims brings musicians together and also helps to create an identity for the genre that has taken the country by storm. “We applaud Express Entertainment for working with us to uplift talents as the idea of riddims is good because it keeps the identity of the genre as well as bring musicians together,” he said.
