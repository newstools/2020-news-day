BY FREEMAN MAKOPA ZIMDANCEHALL chanter Killer T has lashed out at local arts awards for lacking transparency in the way they are conducted. After many of his fans asked him on his social media platforms why he had been missing in local awards, Killer T told NewsDay Life & Style that he felt the awards processes were opaque. He said that was the reason a lot of musicians doing well failed to make it onto nomination lists, let alone win awards, and he has since stopped submitting his music for consideration. “These awards are fake and we have ceased to participate in them because we don’t know the criteria they use to nominate musicians and you see others bagging three or four awards, yet we have some artistes who have been doing well but do not get anything,” he said. “Awards are meant to appreciate the work being done by musicians in the entertainment industry, but we just wonder why we don’t make it in those. But we don’t mind anymore because we just want to make music which is good for the people and urge our fans not to worry about awards but to wait to hear what we have in store for them,” he said. The artiste said there was need for clear mechanisms around the awarding processes, which should be disclosed to the public for  purposes of transparency. “At least if we don’t know how the voting criteria is conducted, it was better if we knew their expectations or what they want on albums or songs and let the fans do the voting,” he said. Killer T is currently riding high on his new offering, Hazvigone, which stood at 200 000 views as of yesterday.
