 In 2003 I came to confinement and stayed for six months at the D section.  Prison is not the end of the world, but rather a time to plan and strategize your life after prison,” he said. Zivhu donated an assortment of goods including sanitary pads, diapers, a cake as well as fastfood  to inmates and their minor children.
