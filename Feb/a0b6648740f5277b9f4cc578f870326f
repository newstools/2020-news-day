Intwasa director Raisedon Baya confirmed the developments to NewsDay Life & Style yesterday. “We are introducing a new dialogue series and Patience Phiri is leading it. She is the face and brains of the project. We are providing technical and moral support,” he said. “Mostly the dialogue is about interfacing with policy makers and influencers and seeing where the arts can plug in and utilise opportunities.” Baya said they were interested in seeking opportunities within that ministry that the creative sector could plug in for profitability. “It’s strictly by invite and we invited people and organisation we think add value to the dialogue,” he said.
