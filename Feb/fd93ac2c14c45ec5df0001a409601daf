BY SPORTS REPORTER SOUTH Africa Rugby Union (SARU) has confirmed Zimbabwe’s participation in the 2020 edition of the SuperSport Rugby Challenge for the second successive season following the country’s inclusion in the schedule for this year’s tournament which kicks off on the weekend of April 25. The confirmation for this year’s competition comes after Zimbabwe made their debut in South Africa’s second tier domestic competition last year, where a local development side competed under the Zimbabwe Academy banner. The Zimbabwe Academy, who will be aiming to register their first win of the campaign this year after a winless debut season, will yet again start their campaign in the South Section. The group also features South African provincial sides Western Province, Border, Sharks XV, Free State XV, Boland Cavaliers, SWD and EP Elephants. Zimbabwe Academy will for the second year running play out of their Cape Town base at False Bay Rugby Club in Constantia and will have their campaign against Cell C Sharks at a venue yet to be confirmed on the weekend of April 24-26. Meanwhile, the North Zone features neighbours Namibia, who will compete under the Welwitschias, Pumas, Valke, Griquas, Griffons, Golden Lions XV, Leopards and the Blue Bulls XV. The top two teams in each section will progress to the semifinals (June 13/14), with the two semifinal winners meeting in the final scheduled for the last weekend of June. Western Province won the inaugural SuperSport Rugby Challenge edition in 2017 while the Pumas were champions in 2018 before losing their title to Griquas last year. Zimbabwe’s participation in the SuperSport Rugby Challenge means they will have a busy season in which they will also participate in the 2020 Rugby Africa Cup and the Victoria
Cup.
