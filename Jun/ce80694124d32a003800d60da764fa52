Since it was introduced as the sole legal tender in June last year, the Zimbabwe dollar has lost around 90% of its value against the United States dollar, leading to fears that it could follow a similar path to its predecessor, which the country abandoned in February 2009 after it was ravaged by hyperinflation.
