THREE MDC Alliance activists — Harare West MP Joanna Mamombe, Cecilia Chimbiri and Nestai Marova — who are facing charges of communicating falsehoods over their alleged abduction, were yesterday granted bail by the High Court. By Harriet Chikandiwa The trio, who were represented by Jeremiah Bamu and Alec Muchadehama of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, were released on $10 000 bail each. As part of their bail conditions, they were ordered to report to the police three times a week and not to interfere with witnesses. They were also restricted from communicating with the media or posting on social media platforms.
Allegations are that on May 13 this year, the accused and accomplices gathered at Warren Park 1 shopping centre in Harare and demonstrated against alleged misuse of COVID-19 funds by government and recall of MDC Alliance legislators by the Thokozani Khupe-led MDC-T faction. The court heard that on the same day, the accused advised their lawyers, friends and family through telephone calls and texts that they had been arrested by the police on their way into the city centre and taken to Harare Central Police Station. The court heard that checks were made by the police and it was established that the accused had not been arrested. The three were picked up two days later at Muchaponmdwa business centre in Bindura South.
The police claimed the three faked their abduction and tainted the country’s image.
The three are denying the charges.
