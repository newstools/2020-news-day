BY KENNETH NYANGANI MUTARE City Council has embraced gospel musician Jairos Mutambikwa (pictured) as its ambassador after he recently penned a song celebrating the picturesque mountainous city and encouraging residents to pay their rates. In the six-minute single, Jewel of Manicaland, which was released a few weeks ago, Mutambikwa focused on the importance of paying rates by residents and business owners to enable the local authority to deliver services. The artiste told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that he was happy to be Mutare City ambassador. “It’s an honour to become a Mutare ambassador and I will work very hard to sing about the beauty of my Mutare City,” he said. City spokesperson Spren Mutiwi saluted the talented gospel artiste. “He (Mutambikwa) was inspired by the developments on the ground,  the new changes which he has observed upon assumption of duty by the new administration led by mayor Blessing Tandi and town clerk Joshua Maligwa,” he said. “The story is profiling the positives that have been made and basically it’s an expression by a Mutarean appreciating and taking ownership of the affairs of the city.” Mutiwi said such sense of responsibility was lacking among most residents who ignored their obligation to settle their arrears or proffer payment plans. “By virtue of taking such a bold decision, Mutambikwa has become our ambassador in speaking positively about our city, where he was born and lives,” he said. “Charity begins at home. Let’s partner our local authority in pushing brand visibility and creating a better city.” Mutambikwa has so far released two albums and several singles. The Victory Melodies frontman and United Methodist Church choir singer is a big fan of South African gospel legend Sipho Makhabane.
