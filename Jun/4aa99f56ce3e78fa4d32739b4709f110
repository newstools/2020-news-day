BY HARRIET CHIKANDIWA TWO Malawian nationals on Sunday escaped from the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) Hotel quarantine centre in Beitbridge after testing positive for COVID-19, police have said. This brought the cumulative number of escapees to 184, with only 28 accounted for. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi yesterday urged the public to report suspected escapees and border jumpers evading the COVID-19 screening process. Nyathi said police on Sunday arrested 914 people across the country for various offences related to contravention of the national lockdown regulations, bringing the total number of arrests to 75 134 since the lockdown came into effect on March 30. Meanwhile, police yesterday extended condolences to four members of the security forces who died in a road traffic accident at the 106km peg along the Harare-Shamva Road on Sunday while on COVID-19 lockdown enforcement duties.
