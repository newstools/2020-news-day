Gweru City Council Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) which has been closed for refurbishment to be used as an isolation centre for people suspected to have coronavirus is ready to be utilised, Vice-President, Kembo Mohadi has said. By Stephen Chadenga Speaking yesterday after touring the facility, Mohadi said he was impressed by the renovations and commended the local authority for spearheading the revamping of the health centre. “I understand this facility had been run down but they managed to bring it back to life,” Mohadi said. ”The hospital is now ready to accept COVID-19 patients and I am happy about that. This is quite commendable.” Gweru mayor Josiah Makombe said the renovations had been made possible by various donations from local companies. Gweru businesswoman Smelly Dube’s River Valley Properties, Zambezi Bulk Drilling, Sino Zimbabwe and Unki Mine combined resources to renovate the quarantine centre. ”Some companies donated building material, others drilled a borehole while some assisted with bedding material,” Makombe said. “The new look is quite state-of-the-art. We would like to thank everyone who helped in the refurbishment of our isolation centre.” The latest development comes as a relief to residents in the populous Mkoba suburb who were complaining that infectious diseases patients who had been temporarily transferred to Mkoba 1 Clinic from the infectious hospital were posing a health risk to the community. Council closed the clinic to the general public to pave way for isolation hospital patients as the hospital was undergoing renovation.
