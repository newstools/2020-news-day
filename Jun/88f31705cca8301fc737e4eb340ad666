SMALL-SCALE gold miners in Gwanda have arrested suspected robbers who attacked Muzenda Mine near Coleen Bawn, 20km south of the Matabeleland South provincial capital. BY REX MPHISA The suspected robbers, travelling in a small Honda Fit car, raided the mine wielding an assortment of weapons. Provincial police spokesman Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the incident, but distanced the police from the robbers following the recovery of a truncheon, mostly used by the police. “We are holding two men who are assisting with investigations. We are charging them with unlawful entry. Two others are still at large.  The four are suspected of having broken into Muzenda Mine, but they did not use machetes,” Ndebele said. Police recovered a truncheon, a knife and a small axe in the suspects’ getaway vehicle.
One of the small-scale miners alleged yesterday the suspects were using a vehicle registered in the name of a police officer stationed in Bulawayo. “We apprehended the suspects and took them to the police station before 8pm on Tuesday, but police took their time recording the details and almost released the suspects. Being the only incident, we don’t see why we had to leave the police station at 2am. This raised our suspicions,” the official said. The two were expected to appear in court yesterday. The hunt for the outstanding two is still on.
