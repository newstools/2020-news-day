“We are pleased to inform you that the Ministry of Youth, led by deputy minister  Tinomudaishe Machakaire, has taken over Marabha’s medical bills,” he said. “He is getting better and tomorrow (today) we are taking him for review but his situation is getting better and we hope to see him going back to work soon.” Marabha is suffering from memory loss and sometimes falls unconscious only to recover after a few hours.
