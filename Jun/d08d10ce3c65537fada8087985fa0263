SEVERAL local gospel musicians and groups have been lined up for this evening’s concert — organised by the Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation ministry — which is set to conclude the day of prayer and fasting declared by President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week.

A spokesperson for the ministry, Ransom Madzamba, confirmed the show scheduled to air live on TV, NACZ  and the former’s Facebook page from 9pm till late. “Following President Mnangagwa’s declaration that today is Day of Prayer and Fasting we have chosen to break it through music in praise and worship.  The theme of the concert is thus Breaking the Fast in Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic,” he said. The declaration has met with mixed reaction, with some clerics and analysts arguing Mnangagwa needed to clean up his governance system before appealing for divine help.
