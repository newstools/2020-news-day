THE State yesterday declined to prosecute former Mutare City Council chamber secretary Cephas Vuta, who was arrested on Sunday for allegedly stealing trust property, saying that it was an administrative  matter. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Vuta was also charged with criminal nuisance after he was accused of verbally insulting town clerk Joshua Maligwa at council offices recently. Prosecutor Tirivanhu Mutyasira said the case of abuse of trust property was an administration issue which should be dealt with at Mutare City Council as an act of misconduct. “On the issue of trust property, we referred the matter to police with a view that there was no criminal offence, but was supposed to be disciplinary or an act of misconduct. He was given money to use, but did not follow proper procedures to retain the money,” he said. “On the other matter of criminal nuisance where Vuta allegedly insulted Mutare town clerk Joshua Maligwa, we summoned the matter to July 7 at the Mutare Magistrates Court,” he said. Mutyasira said all the matters were heard in his office. Vuta’s lawyer Passmore Nyakureba also confirmed the new development. “Our client was given a subsistence and travel allowance to go to Masvingo for a workshop, but the workshop failed because a lockdown was imposed. Our client then failed to travel because of the COVID-19 lockdown, and everything is in order,” Nyakureba said. Vuta was allegedly given almost $12 000 to attend a workshop in Masvingo. He was suspended over insubordination before they settled for a mutual termination of contract where the latter got hefty terminal benefits. Vuta accused Maligwa for his suspension, claiming that there was bad blood between them.
