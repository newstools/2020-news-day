SOUTH AFRICA-BASED soul musician Oliver Matsika has collaborated with a Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) musician Benzo in a single track titled Mama Africa, in which they celebrate the beauty of Africa. BY KENNETH NYANGANI The musician told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that he had gained a wealth of experience in his music career after sharing the stage with some of South Africa’s finest musicians. Matsika said the latest duet was inspired by his love for Africa. “I have released a new single titled Mama Africa in which I collaborated with Benzo who is from the Democratic Republic of Congo,” he said. “In the song, I am singing about this beautiful motherland. What I am simply saying in the song is that I believe in Africa. I believe that Africa can make it to the top of the world with its beauty and everything in it.” Matsika said it was unfortunate that there were people that looked down upon Africa and it was because of its natural wealth that it fell victim to colonialism. “I am very aware that there are people who look down upon Africa, but God created Africa in a certain way and that is the reason why some countries colonised the continent,” he said. The song was recorded by Malawian producer, Chris Kele, who is regarded as one of the finest producers in the southern African country. Matsika, who has worked with different groups and shared the stage with many artistes, has two albums under his belt — Prayer, Testimony and Prayer 24/7. During the Cyclone Idai fundraising show held in Johannesburg, South Africa last year, Matsika worked with artistes Yvonne Chakachaka and PJ Powers to raise funds, food and clothing items for victims of the cyclone in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi.
