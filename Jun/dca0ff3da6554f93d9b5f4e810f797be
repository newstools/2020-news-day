Business mogul and Zanu PF benefactor John Arnold Bredenkamp has died. He was 79. By Enock Muchinjo Bredenkamp, who passed away in Harare on Thursday, captained the then Rhodesia’s rugby team between 1965 and 1968. He featured in a number of international “Test” matches for the African nation, as well as in neighbouring South Africa’s premier domestic competition, the Currie Cup. Bredenkamp attended boys’ school, Prince Edward, which has a proud history of producing several international sportsmen, amongst them ex-Springbok rugby players like John Robertson and Tonderai Chavhanga. Over the years, having amassed wealth from his business empire, Bredenkamp donated very generously to his beloved alma mater. John Falkenberg, a former Zimbabwe Rugby Union president, who was also educated at Prince Edward, paid tribute to his departed namesake. “He was a very proud old PE boy who did quite a lot for the school and he played in one of the best PE rugby teams in history,” Falkenberg said. “Obviously, he also captained this country with distinction and was a brilliant rugby player. He was a proud man, very proud of his school and very proud of his country.” Falkenberg, under whose stewardship Zimbabwe came just moments from qualifying for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, added: “When I was the Tigers (Prince Edward rugby team) captain in 1986, he provided all the equipment for us, and made all tours possible due to his generosity. He also did a lot to the music department. He will be greatly missed.”
