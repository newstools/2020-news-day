FORMER Highlanders captain Dazzy Kapenya  has set his sights on coaching in the Premier Soccer League (PSL). BY FORTUNE MBELE He said while it would be a dream come true for him to coach his former club Highlanders where he enjoys legendary status, he was open to coach any other team in the top division. The former Highlanders defender is currently head coach at Zifa Southern Region Division One side Casmyn and will need to obtain a Caf A licence to take charge of a PSL team. He currently holds a Caf C licence. Caf courses are currently suspended and this has left many local coaches who aspire to coach at the top level, including Kapenya, in a quandary. “I have ambitions to coach in our PSL,” Kapenya said. “I know it is everyone’s dream to coach a team he played for and it will be nice to coach Highlanders if I get the chance. I am focusing on my coaching career and whoever needs my services in the near future I will be available. I have to start somewhere as a person.” Highlanders have previously shown a penchant of hiring its former sons to the position of head coach, with varying successes. Former players who have coached the club include Rahman Gumbo who won them two league titles as well as Methembe Ndlovu, who won them their last league title in 2006. The late Barry Daka, Madinda Ndlovu, Amini Soma-Phiri and Cosmas Zulu have also coached the club. Kapenya said he would upgrade his coaching certificates at the next available opportunity.
“I am a holder of a Caf C Licence and I am still looking forward to acquiring more Caf badges when they become available.” Before joining Casmyn, Kapenya had been coaching at junior clubs and schools including Falcon College.
