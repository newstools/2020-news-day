BULAWAYO gospel artistes on Sunday launched a healing session gospel project — Bulawayo United (Sibambene) with organisers saying it was well-received by gospel fans. BY SHARON SIBINDI The project, aimed at giving hope to those who have drawn away from God during this COVID-19 period, was launched on Fusion Media (FM) Group live session dubbed Let’s Worship. “As part of the project, our plan is to do a quadrant. By this I mean we release four singles. So far one single is out and it’s doing well. We get more views everyday,” said Nigel Tatenda Nyamweda of OneSpirit, who is spearheading the project. “So it was launched on Sunday and it was viewed by over 4 000 people and we made it to YouTube and hopefully by end of week we would have received more views and responses from the viewers.”
Nyamweda said plans were afoot to launch a video next month. “From here we will also a  launch a documentary on July 1 — the documentary will see profiles of some of the artistes involved in the project introducing themselves as a brand and give a brief background,” he said. “Then mid-July release the official music video for the single we released on Sunday. After the music video we intend to  work on track number 2 and repeat the same process until we are done with all the four tracks.” The multilingual track features artistes such as Mai Mwamuka, Sipho “Snowy” Ncube, Ambassador Kira, Nkosi Herman, Faith Mucha, Chelsea Mguni, Lorraine Maplanka Stot and Reward Judah Ndlovu with  Vocal X and One Spirit merging as the backing
vocalists.
