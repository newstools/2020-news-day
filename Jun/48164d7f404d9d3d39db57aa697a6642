I WOULD like to urge the people of Zimbabwe to open their eyes. Zanu PF will continue with its empty promises. This time we must say enough is enough to these endless empty promises. Zanu PF launched its manifesto in 2018, which was totally useless considering what the people were promised by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. He promised to stabilise the economy in a few days, bring in investors and create jobs, but in actual fact, the economy is now worse off than it was under the late former President Robert Mugabe. Mnangagwa promised to arrest corruption, but has dismally failed to do so. Instead, his politicians are now busy fronting it. The Zanu PF government promised to review the working conditions of all civil servants starting with critical areas, but so far, civil servants have been banned from demonstrating, nurses were fired, teachers were threatened. Taking into consideration all these factors, Zanu PF must not expect to get my vote anymore. By Mbada, Our Reader
