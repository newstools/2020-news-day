KENNETH NYANGANI The song, which was released this week, is accompanied by a sleek video shot in the scenic Vumba Mountains and at one of Manicaland’s tourism wonders, the picturesque Nyachowa Falls by talented videographer Zorodzai Chibuwe. “I decided to release the song and the video concurrently so that people will have something to cheer about during this COVID-19 period. I took my time to come up with a unique and dynamic song like this and I believe my fans will love it. This is a prayer of someone who is asking for God’s intervention to better his life,” she said. “There are situations where one fails to be productive because of the evil forces that will be following them. So, this is a dejected voice pleading with God to light the way and lead a prosperous life. This is prayer to God to assist everyone, families and individuals for breakthrough especially during this difficult period with faith and belief that all shall come to pass and lead a better life.” Jackie, who is currently riding high with a debut album, Love Me as I Am, has headlined girl child empowerment events and rubbed shoulders with renowned jazz artistes such as Victor Kunonga.
