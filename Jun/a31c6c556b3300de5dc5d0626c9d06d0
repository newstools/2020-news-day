BY FREEMAN MAKOPA SOUTH AFRICA-BASED fast-rising rapper-cum-model Annastacia Yona (pictured) says she is currently working on an extended play titled Femicide which tackles the abuses and killing of women by the men who are supposed to protect them. The songbird, who is riding high on her latest offering, Make EM Dance, told NewsDay Life & Style that it has not been an easy journey working and gaining recognition in a foreign land. “I am working on an EP which I am not sure when it’s dropping but I have a project coming soon which is about femicide. Women are being abused and killed by the ones who are supposed to protect them and as a lady, you know the pain, so raising my voice on behalf of others and for myself is what I chose,” she said. “Well, recognition is one of the best achievements I have made so far. The support is very huge. The acceptance is very good. It’s like South Africa was waiting for my arrival.” The 20–year–old Yona, who has been previously nominated for songs at the Zim Hip Hop and Changamire Hip Hop awards, said COVID-19 had slowed down the progress on her upcoming projects. “I haven’t done any big shows because the time I got into the South African music scene, COVID-19 came around and slowed down progress,” she said. “Radio stations have been putting my songs on rotation and on social media and blogs the love has been amazing. The fan base is growing by the day and it’s overwhelming.” On doubling up as a model, Yona said although she was making waves, she had not discarded modelling. “As for modelling, I have been signed to FPA Agency, one of the best agencies in South Africa. I have done a couple of works with them and I am looking forward to doing more,” she said.
