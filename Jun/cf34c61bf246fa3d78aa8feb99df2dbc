THE Zimbabwe United Passengers Company (Zupco) has hiked fares by 100% barely three months after an increase by the same margin in March putting pressure on the already economically overburdened commuters. BY STEPHEN CHADENGA The new fares will see Gweru passengers forking out $4 for a trip on Zupco buses up from $2 and commuter omnibuses charging $8 from $4. Repeated efforts to get a comment from Zupco chief executive Everisto Madangwa proved fruitless as he did not pick his phone. He also did not respond to questions sent to him. But commuters, who spoke to this paper, said the public transporter should have notified them before hiking the fares. “I only learnt of the increase this morning (yesterday) when I was about to board a kombi,” Constance Mariko from Ascot Extension suburb, said. James Chiseko said he got to know of the fares through social media platforms and accused Zupco of “unprofessionalism”. “Honestly, there was need for Zupco officials to make use of formal communication channels to announce bus fare hikes,” he said. “We cannot have a situation where we just wake up to social media messages that fares have been increased only to learn that it’s actually the reality. Zupco should communicate in time when it intends to hike fares so that as commuters we are not caught unaware.” Other commuters interviewed said they would now resort to walking to the city as they could not afford the new fares.
