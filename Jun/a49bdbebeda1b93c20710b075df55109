Almost everyone in the comment section was asking who Boss D is and some jokingly  came up with assumptions that it might be the President ED who had decided  to venture into music promotion but the truth is no one knows who he is even the team behind the show. Speaking to Lewis John  who is one of the admins on Zimcelebs, he revealed how Boss D approached them together with Stewart Nyamayaro to start the show and how he wanted to remain anonymous. “We got a message in our inbox on Zimcelebs Instagram page from an account “Bossd351” and he said I want you guys to do lockdown shows and I will pay for everything and I want to remain anonymous and you just tell me what you need. We have never met him we only talk on Instagram and he just tells us where to pick up the money for payments:. He said Comedian Kuda Chamisa took to Instagram to express his gratitude and commented on the Boss D Lockdown part 2 performances and threw shade at Prophet Passion saying his live videos had too many adverts of him unlike boss d. “Ndoda kungo bigger boss d haa live yamakaita nezuro yanga yakaipa..zvasiyana nevapfanha ana twabam vekuti everytwo minutes n’e n’e n’e n’e gore regonzo ha wangu unoneta unomuguta every two minutes pari kubuda ma Lamborghini ma ferrari ne ndege wangu pamunenge mapedza munenge maguta but Boss D makapaita pasina kana problem hatisati tambokuonai plus vanhu vese vakagona” he commented .
