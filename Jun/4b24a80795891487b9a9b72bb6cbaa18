Thousands of Shamva residents are wallowing in poverty following the closure of Shamva Gold Mine last year. BY VANESSA GONYE recently in Shamva Speaking at a handover ceremony of groceries and other goods in Shamva at the weekend by Hamilton Insurance, Lands and Agriculture minister, Perrance Shiri lamented the deplorable state the people were living in, a situation further worsened by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Shiri said the people who live in Shamva urban had been unlucky in terms of food aid from the donor community whose focus was largely on the rural areas. “As you can see, these faces are of a people suffering, therefore, the donation will go a long way,” Shiri said. Shiri urged communities to set aside political differences and work together in the fight against COVID-19. Speaking at the same event, Hamilton Insurance general manager Joyce Nousenga, said her company decided to help people in Shamva after they were advised of their dilemma. She noted the residents were not receiving food aid at a time when many had been rendered unproductive owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of the mine. “We were advised of a number of disabled people in Shamva town who are being left out from NGO donations. We, therefore, decided to help about 150 families in three wards (50 from each ward) targeting the old, disabled and orphans (many of whom are living in child-headed families),” she said.
