BY KENNETH NYANGANI POPULAR Mutare bouncer Pension Gwinyai appeared in court early this week for attempted murder after knocking down a soldier with his vehicle following a scuffle at a night club. Gwinyai (52), who is popularly known as Master Payee in the eastern border city, appeared before magistrate Nyasha Kuture, who remanded him in custody to October 26. His lawyer Chris Ndlovu indicated that the bouncer sustained head injuries after the complainant, Kudzai Nedziwe, struck him with a stone during the scuffle. The court heard that on October 10, 2020, Nedziwe refrained Gwinyai from assaulting an unidentified patron, leading to a brawl. Gwinyai then allegedly punched Nedziwe in the face, leading to a fistfight. Gwinyai then got into his vehicle and sped towards Nedziwe who was walking back home, knocking him down headlong. Nedziwe is currently admitted at 3 Field Hospital in Mutare with his condition said to be critical.
