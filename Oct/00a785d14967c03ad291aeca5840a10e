BY KENNETH NYANGANI A CHIPINGE man, who killed his brother in a scuffle over a goat has been slapped with a 25-year jail term by High Court judge Justice Isaac Muzenda. It is the State’s case that on October 16 last year, the convict, Tawanda Hlahla (25) had a misunderstanding with his elder brother Sifiso. The court heard that the convict slaughtered Sifiso’s goat. During the same week, Sifiso questioned his younger brother about his goat and a misunderstanding ensued. The convict struck the now-deceased with a machete once on the back of his head. Sifiso bled profusely from the wound and died upon admission at Chipinge Hospital.
