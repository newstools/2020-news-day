It was shot and produced by talented videographer, Zororai Chibuwe. “The song encourages people to work hard for their future and to grind for the betterment of their lives.

We travelled to Aberfoyle in Honde Valley as well as in selected majestic areas in Vumba and Dangamvura Quarry site. We are going to drop the video early October,” she said. Jackie has been the fastest rising female artise in Mutare and Zimbabwe at large. “I am overwhelmed by the support that I am receiving from fellow artistes and fans. It is encouraging. I am getting new fans everyday because of the Afro-fusion feel as well as a captivating video,” she added.
