BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE President Emmerson Mnangagwa has set up a tribunal to inquire into the conduct of two members of the Zimbabwe Land Commission who are accused of authoring and uploading a document onto the World Bank website which negatively portrayed the country’s land reform programme. The tribunal was appointed in terms of Proclamation 6 of 2020, SI 229 of 2020, to investigate the conduct of the commission’s deputy chairperson Tadious Muzoroza and commissioner Jeanette Marrie Manjengwa. Mnangagwa said a team led by retired judge Justice Maphios Cheda, and comprising Angeline Vere and Godfrey Mutseyekwa would investigate the allegations levelled against the two officials. “The tribunal shall be held for a period of five months from the date of swearing in of members at such appropriate venue as shall be determined by the tribunal. The report shall be availed within one month after the conclusion of the inquiry,” read the team’s terms of reference. “They will investigate whether Muzoroza and Manjengwa’s conduct amounts to gross misconduct or whether they co-authored and uploaded onto World Bank Conference website an abstract which painted a negative picture of the land reform programme in respect of the land tenure and allocation of land to women, youth and farm workers.” Mnangagwa on Tuesday set up another probe team to investigate the conduct of Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission commissioner Frank Muchengwa who was suspended on corruption allegations. A tribunal consisting of retired judge Justice Nicholas Ndou, Tarisai Mutangi and Tecla Mapota was set to investigate the commissioner. Muchengwa is accused of receiving bribes and leaking confidential information concerning the matters he was investigating. He was also accused of presiding over a matter in which he had intrests. The tribunal was also given five months to investigate and report to the President in writing.
