BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE THE Supreme Court has struck off the roll the matter in which Mugodhi church members were challenging their late leader Tadewu Mugodhi’s decision to anoint his son heir apparent. Mugodhi’s sons Washington, Innocent and Enock recently filed an appeal at the Supreme Court after High Court judge Justice Owen Tagu endorsed Tony Sigauke as leader according to the church’s constitution. The Supreme Court, however struck the matter off the roll on a technicality after the church submitted minutes in vernacular language of meetings endorsing Sigauke as successor. The ruling has temporarily given Mugodhi’s sons a reprieve and access to the church premises. “The pronouncement by the late Bishop Mugodhi that Washington Mugodhi is now acting church leader is declared unlawful. The vice bishop, Sigauke be and is hereby confirmed as acting bishop,” Justice Tagu ruled. Tadewu died in October last year, plunging the church in a fierce succession fight after he anointed his son Washington as his successor, with other leaders accusing him of breaching the constitution by making unilateral decisions and seeking medication at a South African hospital. According to the church’s constitution, if a congregant seeks medical attention, they are supposed to be cleansed first before donning church regalia again. If one dies in hospital, congregants are not allowed to wear church uniform at the funeral. In Tadewu’s case, he was supposed to be cleansed by the church leadership before he could resume his role after being hospitalised.
