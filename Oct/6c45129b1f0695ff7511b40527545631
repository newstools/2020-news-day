BY HARRIET CHIKANDIWA A HEALTH hazard looms in Harare after the city’s main water treatment plant, Morton Jaffray Waterworks, was shut down yesterday due to shortage of aluminium sulphate. In a notice to residents, council said its main supplier raised the red flag on Monday last week appealing for financial assistance to import 1 000 tonnes of the commodity. “Please be advised that we have no choice, but to shut down Morton Jaffray Waterworks at about 1800 hours today (yesterday) due to stockout of aluminium sulphate, the major water treatment chemical,” the statement read. “Zimphos, the supplier of the said chemical, raised red flag on Monday October 11, indicating that they had run out of bauxite, the primary raw material used to manufacture aluminium sulphate and needed assistance with
US$2 583 required for VAT payment purpose to import 1 000 tonnes of the commodity.” Built by Rhodesians in 1953 to support a population of 300 000 people, the plant has been struggling to cope with the city’s surging population, now estimated at three million. “As of Wednesday October 21, Zimphos indicated that the required amount had been paid to their suppliers. However, positive proof of payment into their bank account was required before the goods could be dispatched,” council added. “There will be reduced production during the day up to 6pm and a total loss of production for a projected 16 hours commencing today (yesterday).”
