BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE BUSINESSMAN Manson Mnaba, who was implicated in a recent land audit report for grabbing State land and unlawfully allocating it to homeseekers in Borrowdale, Harare, has denied the allegations saying his company Arosume Properties was duly authorised to transfer the stands in question. Mnaba was accused of grabbing 50 stands at Carrick Creagh Farm in Borrowdale and parcelling out the land. The company, in a statement, dismissed the accusations as baseless claiming the project was approved by government. “We were duly allocated the 50 stands as security against development loss for development costs and the transfer of those stands was legitimate,” Arosume Properties said in a statement. “The issue of these 50 stands was a prerequisite by Arosume to enter this agreement. Without this requirement being met, Arosume would have never entered into this partnership.” The company added: “Transfers were legitimately processed as requested and the government cannot change this position when development is 95% complete. Interference at this stage is retrogressive and prejudicial to Arosume.” The company said the agreement was a win-win deal in that the government achieved its goal of having a first up-market development since independence although Arosume is yet to recoup its development costs. The Commission of Inquiry into the Sale of Urban State Land chaired by Justice Tendai Uchena in its report accused the company of prematurely transferring 50 stands allocated to it as security in a project involving government. The company was also accused of unlawfully subdividing stands allocated to beneficiaries at Carrick Creagh Farm in Borrowdale, selling State land allocated to beneficiaries and fraudulently demanding excessive development fees. The Uchena commission has since submitted its findings to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
