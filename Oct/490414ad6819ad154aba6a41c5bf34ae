THE National Convention Bureau (NCB) has said this year’s annual Sanganai/Hlanganani World Tourism Expo will be part of the tourism recovery plan to achieve a US$5 billion economy by year 2025. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The organiser of the annual expo, Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA), has set October 22 and 23 for this year’s event to be held virtually in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic. NCB acting executive director Pauline Ndlovu said ZTA had taken the decision to adapt and create an immersive multi-media experience for businesses seeking to market their goods and services in a world locked down by COVID-19 restrictions. “The virtual exhibition that will be one of the first of its kind to be hosted in Africa forms part of the tourism recovery plan with the aim of achieving a US$5 billion economy by 2025,” Ndlovu said in a statement on Tuesday. “The Zimbabwe government recently reopened the tourism sector and this development is likely to boost both domestic and international visits to local attractions.”
She said online registration was already open. “To date more than 150 local and international exhibitors have registered to interact with more than 100 top buyers from across the globe. Zimbabweans are encouraged to join the discussions or follow the discussions on the ZTA’s social media platforms such as the ZTA Updates Facebook Page and ZTA YouTube,” Ndlovu
said. She added that destination presentations would share the state of preparedness of tourism venues and facilities throughout the country, adding that participants would be able to interact with presenters so they may be able to address their concerns.
